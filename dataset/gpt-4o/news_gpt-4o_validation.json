[{"raw_text": "Kindred and Simmonds both swam a powerful final 50 metres to break world records in their respective SM6 200m medley races. Rodgers then set a personal best in the S7 50m butterfly to win Britain's fifth gold of the day. It takes Britain's total tally in Rio to 63, with 28 golds. Kindred, 38, clocked two minutes 38.47 seconds to secure his seventh Paralympic gold, before 21-year-old Simmonds retained her title in 2:59.81. Will Bayley, in the class 7 table tennis, and Aled Davies, in the F42 shot put, had earlier both taken gold for ParalympicsGB. John Stubbs and Jodie Grinham won silver in the mixed team compound open archery, before Jonathan Broom-Edwards finished second in the T44 high jump final. Relive it all here. Simmonds held the world record in the medley coming into the Games and set a new Paralympic record in the heats, but she admitted to feeling nervous before the final. However, she timed her race well, powering through the final two lengths to beat the record she set in December 2015. \"I don't feel like anything at the minute. It's hard to describe, but I think it's because I'm really focused on the 400m freestyle tomorrow,\" Simmonds, who was born with achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism, told BBC Radio 5 live. \"I didn't feel any pressure. I'm just really relaxed, enjoying myself, having fun. I just want to go out there and race - we train everyday for this. After the pressure I had for London 2012, this meet is just a meet.\" Simmonds, who also has medal chances in the 100m breaststroke and 100m freestyle events, added: \"I've already achieved my dream, I've just got another gold tonight and then focus on tomorrow. \"The team are on fire. We're doing an amazing job. I can't wait to race again. This pool is incredible, it's stunning. The atmosphere is amazing.\" Rodgers, who was born without a fully formed arm and leg on the left side of her body, was visibly shocked after securing victory. \"I can't believe I've done that,\" the 33-year-old said. \"I was trying for the silver, if I'm honest. \"I wasn't going to carry on after London 2012.\" Kindred has won 13 medals - seven of them gold - at six Paralympic Games since making his debut in Atlanta in 1996. He was disqualified following his heat in Rio for a lane infringement, but was reinstated following an appeal by British Swimming. Find out how to get into swimming with our inclusive guide. Victory means he will bow out of the Paralympics as champion in the event he won gold in at the 2000 Sydney Games. Kindred, born with a form of cerebral palsy, said the disappointment of London 2012, where he took silver, had pushed him to qualify for Rio. \"The last four years have been just amazing and this is the perfect ending,\" he told BBC Radio 5 live. \"I knew I had more in me and I didn't want London to be my last competitive swimming memory.\" BBC Sport's Elizabeth Hudson in Rio \"Sascha Kindred has been a key part of the GB Paralympic swimming team since he made his international debut in 1994, before many of his current team-mates had even been born, and has been rewarded for the hard work he has put in over the years. \"In the final, he pushed his 38-year-old body to the absolute limit, winning a seventh Paralympic gold in a new world record. \"Kindred is a truly inspiration competitor, a legend of the sport, a man who consistently works hard and a vital source of help and inspiration to his younger team-mates. \"Credit also to Ellie Simmonds and Susie Rodgers, who played their parts in an emotional night for the GB team at the Aquatics Stadium.\" Earlier, an emotional Bayley had jumped on the table after securing victory, and was shown a yellow card by the umpire, before he hugged her as he continued his celebrations. The 28-year-old, who won silver at London 2012, was born with a congenital disorder that affected all four of his limbs, before being diagnosed with cancer at the age of seven. Find out how to get into table tennis with our inclusive guide. \"If it wasn't for getting cancer as a kid and being given a table tennis set to give me something to play with when I was recovering, then I would never have been here,\" he told BBC Sport. \"Four years was a long time to wait and there was no guarantee I would ever get the chance to go for gold again, but I'm so proud to win this.\" His success was followed by Welshman Davies, who beat his nearest rivals by more than one metre as he threw 15.97m. Libby Clegg, who took gold in the T11 100m on Friday, qualified comfortably for the T11 200m along with her guide Chris Clarke. However David Weir, who won four golds in London, was unable to add to his Paralympic tally as he came fifth in the men's T54 400m final. Weir, who became a father for the fourth time just hours before his 400m heat, later qualified second in his T54 1500m heat. Team-mate Richard Chiassaro finished fourth as the Netherlands' Kenny van Weeghel took gold in 46.65 seconds. There was also a strong start for ParalympicsGB in the equestrian, as Sophie Christiansen scored 77.522% - the highest of the competition so far - to top her class. In the wheelchair tennis, Gordon Reid advanced to the men's quarter-finals with a breezy 6-0 6-2 win over France's Frederic Cattaneo. Alfie Hewett also progressed to the next round, before he and Reid had an emphatic 6-2 6-0 victory over Spanish duo Daniel Caverzaschi and Martin de la Puent in the men's doubles. However, Jordanne Whiley lost her singles quarter-final 6-3 6-1 to the Netherlands' Diede de Groot. Brazil's Daniel Dias won his 20th Paralympic gold medal in the men's S5 50m freestyle to loud cheers. Like Dias, American Rebecca Meyers dominated the field in the women's S13 400m freestyle to secure her third gold in Rio. The 21-year-old, who was born with hearing and vision impairments, finished in 4:19.59 to set a new world record. New Zealand's Sophie Pascoe also won her third gold medal, this time claiming victory in the SM4 150m medley. Pascoe, 23, lost her left leg as a two-year-old after a lawnmower accident at her home in Christchurch. Compatriot Liam Malone broke a Paralympic Games record held by South Africa's Oscar Pistorius. The 22-year-old, from Nelson, won gold in the men's 200m T44 final in Rio in a time of 21.06 seconds. Pistorius' record was 21.30 seconds. Raushan Koishibayeva of Kazakhstan took silver in the women's -67kg powerlifting as she made her Paralympic debut aged 50. The mother of three, who has just begun studying at a sport academy, says she has set a target of winning a gold medal at Tokyo 2020. Elsewhere in Central Asia, Uzbekistan's success in Rio - 23 medals has pushed them up to ninth in the table - has got the country searching for more information on the Paralympics... There has been surprise around the world after the top four runners in Sunday's men's T12-13 1500m finished their race in times that would have beaten the Olympic gold medallist Matthew Centrowitz Jr. Gold medallist Abdellatif Baka won the race in 3:48.29, beating Centrowitz's Olympic time of 3:50.00 by just under two seconds.", "text": ["Kindred", "and", "Simmonds", "both", "swam", "a",

Faubourg-d'Amiens cemetery is a memorial to the missing: 35,000 soldiers who were killed in the last two years of World War One. Their bodies were never found but their names are inscribed, row by row. Among them is that of the Welsh footballer James \"Ginger\" Williams. A hundred years ago this month, he was blown up by an exploding mine, aged 30. Williams was at his peak as a footballer when war intervened in 1914. But he soon found himself occupying a very different front line to the one he was familiar with on the football field. The game has changed a lot since the early 1900s but Wales fans might be familiar with the narrative: Energetic, journeymen footballers from lower rung clubs giving their all for the red shirt alongside a sprinkling of more gifted stars. Williams was one such unremarkable footballer. A stocky forward, he played alongside fellow north Walian, Billy Meredith - one of the superstars of the early 20th Century - to win his two caps. While he was not of Manchester United star Meredith's quality, Williams, from Buckley, had proved more than useful. He scored 58 goals for Crystal Palace in the Southern League, mostly as an inside forward. His attitude to the game was reflected in his nickname - \"the Palace terrier\". Busy and tenacious, when switched to centre forward, he scored five goals in a game against Southend at Sydenham in 1909 causing \"as much surprise as delight\" for the 7,000 crowd. As one local newspaper described it \"Williams had fine support and was in his element\". Williams transferred across south London to Millwall but had only a few months at his new club when war was declared. He was in the right place to become one of the first to join what became known as the Footballers' Battalion - the 17th, Middlesex Regiment. This particular \"pals\" battalion was set against a background of growing criticism that matches were still being played, while young men were going off to war. Within four days of the launch at Fulham town hall in December 1914, Williams had added his name. Recruitment posters were soon being displayed outside stadiums encouraging supporters to follow the players in joining up. More than 120 players alone would sign up with the battalion by the following spring, and while training for war at home were given Saturdays off to play for their clubs. Other Welshmen to enlist included Cardiff City's Fred Keenor, just 20, who would suffer a gunshot wound to his thigh at the Somme in July 1916. He was one of the lucky ones. Keenor got to go home and resume a career that would see him lift the FA Cup in 1927 - Welsh club football's greatest triumph - and win 32 Wales caps. Cardiff team-mate Lyndon Sandoe, a full back in his early 20s, became company sergeant major. His honours on the front line would eclipse anything he ever managed on a football pitch. Sandoe was decorated three times for gallantry, including a distinguished conduct medal for \"splendid coolness and fearlessness at all times under intense fire of every description\". James Williams's service record notes that stocky frame: 5ft 5ins tall and with a 37in waist. Eleven months after enlisting, he shipped across to France, leaving a three month old son Kenneth with his wife Sarah in New Cross. It appears Williams was seconded to the Royal Engineers in the spring of 1916 and died on 5 June. His body was never recovered but his name is there at Arras. Palace and Millwall staged a benefit match for his widow and son. His name is also on a plaque remembering Millwall players who died in the war; his family had a large photograph of \"John Will,\" as they called him, wearing one of his Welsh caps on the wall. OTHER WELSH FOOTBALLERS WHO DIED IN WORLD WAR ONE Robert \"Bobby\" Atherton. Born Bethesda, Gwynedd; nine caps for Wales, died 19 October 1917, aged 41. An inside right, his clubs included Hibernian - he was captain and memorably lifted the Scottish Cup in 1902 and also led them to the league title. Retired from playing, Atherton moved back to Edinburgh, where he joined the Merchant Navy as a steward. The SS Britannia carrying iron bound for France was sunk by U-Boat in the English Channel with the loss of 22 crew. Frederick \"Fred\" John Griffiths. Born Presteigne, Powys; two caps for Wales. Killed 30 October 1917, aged 44. A goalkeeper, he won both his Wales caps - against Scotland and England in 1900 - while playing for Blackpool. He went on to play for clubs including Preston and West Ham. His great-grandson Stewart Woodland, who lives in Australia, has spent eight years researching Fred's story. Fred was born in Harper Street in Presteigne, the son of a coal merchant and played for his local club and occasionally for Knighton. Hs burly 6ft 2in, 15st physique saw him work part-time in the metal-working and blacksmithing industries before he launched himself into the world of professional football at the age of 21. Stewart says Fred found himself playing for Tottenham Hotspur in an epic series of FA Cup ties against Southampton in 1901 but despite losing a second replay in a heavy snowstorm it was reported Fred's display was such he was carried \"shoulder high\" by supporters from the station afterwards. Injury cut short his professional career at the age of 33 and he moved to Shirebrook in Derbyshire, where he helped train the local side. He also worked as a bar manager at the village's Station Hotel and by the outbreak of the war also had his own pork butchery business. After joining up he rose to the rank of sergeant in the 15th Battalion Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire (Sherwood Foresters) Regiment and was killed during the Battle of Passchendaele during the \"big push\". Fred is buried in Dozinghem military cemetery, south of the village of Westvleteren in west Flanders, near the French frontier. He left a widow Elizabeth and six children. \"The news of Fred's death caused general sorrow in Shirebrook, where 'Griff', as he was more intimately known, had a wide circle of friends,\" said Stewart. Fred's granddaughter June Woodland has been to pay her respects. \"I feel so proud of him in all he achieved in his life and the ultimate sacrifice he gave,\" she said. \"It was such an emotional time when I went to visit his grave. I wish I had known him\". George Griffiths. Born Chirk, near Wrexham 1865; one cap for Wales; died 7 July 1918, aged 53. Played for his local club Chirk - who were a strong amateur side, winning the Welsh Cup and producing 20 Welsh internationals around the turn of the 20th Century. His granddaughter Barbara said George and his brother Peter both played for Chirk. \"There is a story that they began playing football at school and were trained by the head teacher,\" she said. \"He made them play with a plimsoll on their strongest foot in order to encourage them to use both feet!\" Griffiths worked as a miner before the war and had moved to Leigh in Lancashire, where he had eight children. As inside left, he played for Wales once against Ireland in 1887, a 4-1 defeat. A veteran of the Royal Welch Fusiliers, he was discharged from the Royal Army Service Corps in 1917 after an accident involving his knee - he already had signs of arthritis - and died at home in Leigh a year later. He may also have suffered from the effects of gas but there is nothing on his Army medical record and he died of stomach cancer. Nevertheless, he was given a military funeral. William James Jones. Born Penrhiwceiber, near Aberdare; four caps; died 6 May 1918, aged 41. Became the first player from the South Wales League to represent Wales in 1901, while a player with Aberdare Athletic. He also played briefly for West Ham, then a Southern League club. He joined the Royal Welch Fusiliers in Tonypandy and was killed in Macedonia - now northern Greece. His body was not recovered but he is remembered on a memorial there. Leigh Richard Roose. Born Holt, near Wrexham; 24 caps; died 7 October 1916. One of the most flamboyant personalities of his era - Roose made headlines on and off the pitch as a goalkeeper for clubs from Wrexham, Stoke City to Aston Villa. This son of a pacifist minister always wore the shirt of his old university Aberystwyth under his jersey. Ambitions to become a doctor were diverted by football and a love of the London life. Girlfriends included music hall star Marie Lloyd and he wore Savile Row suits. Roose once hired a train at huge expense so he could get to an away match in Birmingham on time. He joined the Royal Army Medical Corps, and latterly the Royal Fusiliers, for whom he earned the Military Medal during his first engagement with them. Roose's abilities as a goalkeeper to throw a ball it appears extended to grenades. \"Though nearly choked with fumes with his clothes burnt he refused to go to the dressing station,\" says the citation. \"He continued to throw bombs until his arm gave out, and then, joining the covering party, used his rifle with great effect.\" But just weeks later L/Cpl Roose was killed in the final stages of the first battle of the Somme at Gueudecourt, one of 190 dead or missing that day. About 10 miles north of Lens, is another Welsh football connection with the war. Although not a footballer, Lord Ninian Crichton Stuart at least had a claim to fame in that he was the first to kick a ball at Cardiff City's stadium in 1910. The second son of the third Marquess of Bute had stood as a guarantor for \u00c2\u00a390 so Cardiff City could rent their new ground from the local authority. He was an important figure in helping the then Riverside club move to grander surroundings and turn semi-professional. Club historian Richard Shepherd said: \"The club had agreed a lease with the corporation but had to find a number of benefactors - and these had to be in place for the start of the 1910/11 season,\" he said. \"One of the benefactors withdrew at the last minute and Lord Ninian offered to fill the gap. He was particularly well known in Cardiff and added a lot of credibility to the club.\" Ninian Park was subsequently named after him and he was invited to ceremoniously kick off Cardiff's opening match with Aston Villa. Ninian - also a Cardiff Conservative MP - was already commanding officer of the 6th Glamorgan Welch Regiment and when war was declared, more than 840 men and officers - mostly from Swansea and Neath - volunteered and headed for France under him as Lieutenant Colonel. At the Battle of Loos at the start of October 1915, after a decision to evacuate when ammunition ran out near La Bass\u00c3\u00a9e, Ninian was shot dead as he stood on the fire step to rally his men. He was 32. Even after his death, his bequests helped the club. Although Cardiff City now has a new stadium nearby, his contribution was such that one of the stands is named after him and the Ninian gates moved across the road. Around 2,000 of Britain's footballers are estimated to have served in the war, while the Footballers' Battalion alone lost 900 men. Some clubs suffered deeply. Heart of Midlothian in Edinburgh lost seven members of their first team. But Clapton Orient, who as a club provided an astonishing 41 players and staff, could be considered fortunate to lose only three at the Somme. Of the Welsh internationals who died, only a couple were household names and all but John \"Ginger\" Williams had already retired from the game. But those Wales supporters, who were gathering in Arras before the match, might care to imagine the rubble of the town a century ago and just a short distance away, where former heroes played their part and paid the ultimate price.", "text": ["In", "the", "western", "part", "of", "the", "town", "in", "the", "Faubourg-d'Amiens", "cemetery", "is", "a", "memorial", "to", "the", "missing", ":",

More than two thirds of ticket prices across the UK have been either cut or frozen for the 2016-17 season. However, an away ticket in the Championship can now be more expensive than for a Premier League match. This is because top-flight clubs have capped prices for visiting fans at \u00a330. Malcolm Clarke, chairman of the Football Supporters' Federation, said: \"On their current \u00a38.3bn deal, the Premier League could afford to let every single fan in free for every game and still have as much money as they had under the previous deal. \"That gives you an idea of the scale of the amount of money they have got.\" The Premier League said in a statement: \"Clubs are listening to their fans and working hard to make sure that Premier League football is accessible as well as competitive and compelling.\" The study also found replica shirt prices have increased year-on-year and half of top-flight clubs put up the price of their junior shirts. For the first time, we asked clubs for the percentage of male and female season-ticket holders. In the Premier League, 14 clubs responded, with Southampton revealing one in five of their season-ticket holders are women, while at Liverpool the figure is 11%. Other findings include: With the bumper 2016-2019 Premier League TV rights deal coming into effect - which includes \u00a35bn for domestic rights and another \u00a33bn globally - top-flight clubs will each benefit by a minimum of \u00a3100m. In this year's study, we contacted 223 clubs across 23 leagues in England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland and the continent. We have analysed ticket prices in six categories - cheapest matchday, dearest matchday, cheapest away ticket, dearest away ticket, cheapest and dearest season tickets - as well as teas, pies, programmes and junior and adult shirt prices. The rate of inflation over the past year, as measured by the Consumer Price index, is 0.9%, and over the six years of study it is 15.65%. English Football League chief executive Shaun Harvey: \"It's clear to see from the recent research that EFL clubs are working very hard to ensure home and away ticket pricing continues to be as competitive and affordable as possible. \"In addition to the BBC's findings, we know from our own analysis that EFL clubs have reached a significant landmark this season, in attracting over 500,000 season-ticket holders across the three divisions for the first time. \"Quite rightly, clubs make the final decisions on pricing models and we will continue to work with them to ensure the positive trends highlighted are maintained and that football attendances across the three divisions of the EFL continue to thrive.\" Scottish Professional Football League chief executive Neil Doncaster: \"All 42 SPFL clubs work tirelessly to ensure they have a pricing structure which provides as much value for money as possible, especially for families to help attract the next generation of supporters. \"We know that while much progress has been made in three years there is much more that can and needs to be done to help make Scottish football as attractive as it can be to existing and potential customers.\" Football Supporters' Federation chairman Malcolm Clarke: \"We believe it's a positive thing that almost three quarters of ticket prices have been reduced or frozen. That's thanks in no small part to pressure from football supporters up and down the country. \"There is no room for complacency, however, with some Premier League clubs charging far too much for their season tickets and away ticket prices in the Championship being the most expensive in the country. We will remain vigilant and continue our campaigning to make football affordable for this generation of supporters and the next.\" The Premier League: \"Clubs value their fans and appreciate their support. Full and vibrant grounds are a significant part of what makes the Premier League a great football competition. \"Research we published only last week, using club data and analysis by leading professional services company EY, detailed not only the price of tickets, but the number purchased at each price. The research also found that four million tickets are discounted from the publicly listed price through early-bird renewals and concessions. \"The data demonstrated the real prices being paid by fans and what volume of tickets are being sold at what levels, finding that 56% of fans in Premier League stadiums this season will pay \u00a330 or less per game with the average price paid being \u00a331.\" Burnley chief executive David Baldwin: \"What's very evident about Burnley as a town is that it is very much a one-club town. You very rarely see other club colours being worn around the town. It is very much claret and blue. \"We don't take that for granted because what we have to be conscious of is what is affordable to people. You don't want them to fall out of the love of football. \"We've established this year a fans' forum so fans can discuss ticket prices for next year and we already have a number of supporter consultant groups that we discuss our pricing policy with before it goes forward for a recommendation.\" Shadow Sports Minister Dr Rosena Allin-Khan: \"Football should be accessible to everyone, from Sunday League to Premier League. \"I am pleased to see the average cost of Premier League tickets come down this year, but with the amount of television and sponsorship money being pumped into football - more needs to be done. \"Despite the small reduction in ticket prices, the vast majority of fans are priced out of football. Children look up to these players, they are role models for millions - yet it costs \u00a340 for a child to wear the same shirt.\"", "text": ["The", "Price", "of", "Football", ",", "the", "biggest",

Then there's Barcelona 1996, Silverstone 2008 and Nurburgring 1968. All wet-weather races. All exceptional. Mention these grands prix to F1 devotees and they will nod approvingly, because these were occasions when a driver delivered something remarkable that marked him out as a cut above his peers. In the case of Brazil 2016, we may well have another entry to that list - and the man responsible was a 19-year-old named Max Verstappen. \"We witnessed something very special,\" Red Bull team boss Christian Horner said of his driver. \"The way he drove was outstanding. It stands out to me like Ayrton Senna in Monaco and other great drives in history.\" High praise indeed for a man occupying the third step of a podium. Verstappen dropped to 16th after a pit stop with 16 laps to go but fought back to finish on the podium in treacherous wet conditions. Yet his drive was about more than this late climb through the field. He also overtook Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen early on and produced a superb pass on Mercedes' Nico Rosberg to take second place midway through the race. He would have finished there, behind winner Lewis Hamilton, had Red Bull not put him on intermediate tyres at a crucial point. The decision turned out to be an error and Verstappen had to pit again for extreme wet tyres, prompting his climb back. He also rescued a huge spin on the pit straight, preventing the car from hitting the wall and managing to hold on to second. He said it was \"50-50\" between skill and luck. Horner said: \"His move earlier in the race on Rosberg was brave, skilful and totally courageous and later in the race the inter tyre looked like the tyre to be on. \"We could see others starting to go quicker and we took the gamble and then the rain just intensified slightly, particularly around Turn 12. We had to abort that and fit a new set of extreme and then it was over to Max.\" Verstappen looked completely out of the picture when he pitted under the safety car for extreme wet tyres late on. But Red Bull knew what their man was capable of, and so did he. \"Can you make your way through the field on full wets?\" came the question from the pit wall. Verstappen said he could and dived in for fresh boots. What followed was hugely impressive, to say the least. The midfield runners were swiftly dispatched and, within a couple of laps, Verstappen was up to 12th place. That became 11th when he passed the Williams of Valtteri Bottas, while team-mate Daniel Ricciardo had no answer either as the teenager moved back into the points. Daniil Kvyat was next, then Esteban Ocon's Manor and the Sauber of Felipe Nasr. Nico Hulkenberg? No problem. Sebastian Vettel? Done in a few corners. Verstappen even rudely ran the Ferrari off the track for good measure. Carlos Sainz was his next victim as he moved into fourth, and then came the podium-clinching move on Sergio Perez - a gutsy, around-the-outside pass at Turn 10 that he completed in Turn 11 having corrected a big slide on his way through. The Mercedes were too far up the road to do anything about, but Verstappen had made his point. Thirteen places made up in 16 laps. Job done. \"It was a lot of fun, with some scary moments,\" Verstappen said. \"I was a bit disappointed after the last pit stop, but I kept my head down and just kept pushing and I went for it. To come back on to the podium was amazing. \"It was crazy. I thought 'now my race is over'. But the car was great. We had great grip. All the race we had good pace. We could have definitely fought for second but to come back in such a style is also a lot of fun.\" Verstappen said it was \"one of\" his best races and his \"best ever\" in the wet. But he said that his win in the Spanish Grand Prix in May would have a bigger place in his heart. \"Barcelona will always be better because it is a race victory but to come back from 16th felt like a race victory.\" Nico Rosberg on Verstappen's amazing half-spin: \"I arrived in the straight and saw him pointing 90 degrees towards the wall - I was thinking, 'what the hell?!'\" Jos Verstappen, Max's father, who started 106 Formula 1 races: \"I have never seen something like this, he has surprised even me. I have seen many races he did, but today it was incredible. He did himself proud. It is what we want to see more of in F1.\" Mercedes team boss Toto Wolf: \"It was the Verstappen show. It was really unbelievable driving, great entertainment. Physics are being redefined.\" Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda: \"Verstappen was outstanding, the way he passed everybody so it was an interesting race. I knew the guy is good but he proved to everybody what he can do.\" Horatio McSherry: Max Verstappen is driving like a man possessed. Utterly extraordinary. One of the greatest drives I've seen in nearly 30 years of F1. Lauren McCarthy: This driving by Verstappen is simply ridiculous. How on earth is he 19, absolute genius. JavelBleach: Wow. Best race I've seen from one driver for a very long time. Ayrton Senna - 1984 Monaco GP A race remembered as the moment Ayrton Senna truly announced his arrival in the sport. Starting 13th on the grid, the Brazilian, in only his sixth F1 race, came through the field in atrocious wet conditions, passing established front-runners to sit second behind Alain Prost's McLaren when the race was brought to a premature halt on lap 31. It was just a second place and only half points were awarded, but a statement had been emphatically made. F1 had a new star. Ayrton Senna - 1993 European GP Fast-forward nine years and Senna was at it again. By now his reputation as master of wet conditions was legendary, but even so his charge from fifth to first place on the opening lap at Donington had jaws on the floor. It is routinely held up as the best single-lap performance in the history of the sport - and to back it up he won the race by over a minute from second-placed Damon Hill, and by a lap from great rival Prost. Michael Schumacher - 1996 Spanish GP The drive that gave Michael Schumacher his first Ferrari win and earned him the reputation as a legend in the wet. Just two weeks earlier he had slid out of the lead on the first lap at a wet Monaco, but in Barcelona - with the rain pounding down once again - he delivered one his most celebrated drives. The Ferrari was a long way from the best car in the field, but on this day and in Schumacher's hands it was peerless. He took the chequered flag by 45 seconds from Jean Alesi. The 'Regenmeister' had landed. Lewis Hamilton - 2008 British GP We knew Lewis Hamilton was good by midway through 2008, but maybe it took this race to tell us just how good. Hamilton trailed Ferrari's Felipe Massa in the drivers' championship heading into the ninth race of the season, and the two could not have had more contrasting fortunes on this soggy Silverstone day. Massa spun five times en route to a miserable 13th place, two laps down on race winner Hamilton, who judged the conditions to perfection, keeping the car on the island and winning by more than a minute from the chasing pack. Come season's end, he would be champion by a point from Massa, and this was arguably the race where the tide turned. Jackie Stewart - 1968 German GP A truly startling drive from a man who in a few short years would retire from Formula 1 as a three-time world champion. On 4 August 1968, Jackie Stewart had no world titles and just two wins to his name, but by the end of the day the sport had a new superstar. In wet and foggy conditions at the unforgiving 14-mile Nurburgring, and sporting a broken wrist, Stewart produced a performance of immense skill and bravery to win by four minutes from Graham Hill. Stewart later described it as \"a tremendously satisfying race to win, but I was very pleased to get it over with\".", "text": ["Monaco", "1984", "is", "one", ",", "so", "is", "Donington", "1993",

lightning bolt in honour of the late David Bowie. And many of the bands will contribute a song from their sets to a live album, which will raise money for Oxfam, in honour of MP Jo Cox. With more than 100 stages spread across the 1,200-acre site, it can be hard to work out what to watch. So here is a guide to 11 of the suggested best acts making the pilgrimage to Worthy Farm. And even if you're not attending, you can catch up with the festival on BBC radio, TV, online and the red button. Formed in Surrey by brothers Guy and Howard Lawrence, Disclosure's exhilarating sound and light show has quickly become a highlight of festivals around Europe. This year, they graduate from the dance arena to Glastonbury's second-biggest venue, The Other Stage, where they top the bill on Friday night, as Howard explains. It's an honour to be asked. The Other Stage - especially this slot we've been asked to do - is something we've wanted to do for a long, long time. For us, it's the pinnacle of what we've ever set out to do at Glastonbury. What acts are you hoping to emulate? People like The Chemical Brothers and The Prodigy. They're some of the few acts we think have done electronic music in a live format and made it a genuinely entertaining show. It's much easier said than done. Calvin Harris recently told us he'd grabbed Rihanna and recorded her vocals for This Is What You Came For in a caravan backstage at the Coachella festival. Do you ever get up to that sort of thing? We always write the songs with the person who's singing it. So we've never done it quite as quickly as that. I guess the closest thing would be a couple of times we've bumped into Sam Smith on tour and literally had him on stage within an hour. Is it really that ramshackle? Generally we try and organise it at least a day or two in advance. But if it comes to it, we can literally decide 10 minutes before we go on. For example, at Coachella, AlunaGeorge were playing on a different stage directly before our slot, so Aluna had to jump off stage at their show, get on a little golf buggy and head straight to us for the first song of our set. She only made it by 10 seconds, so that was pretty touch and go! Psych-rocktonauts Tame Impala have broken into the mainstream with their third album, Currents. Fronted by Kevin Parker, the Australian outfit won best international band at the Brits in February. They play the Pyramid Stage immediately before Adele on Saturday night. You made a guest appearance during Mark Ronson's set last year. Did you have any idea at that point that you'd be coming back as the second headliner in 2016? Obviously not! What's lucky for us is each year has new surprises in store. Things where, if you'd asked us a year earlier, we'd have had no idea they were coming - and this is one of those. But on a bigger scale. What's your Glastonbury experience been like over the years? We actually played the main stage the first time we ever went to Glastonbury. It was about 11:30 in the morning, with people just crawling out of their tents. We were playing mostly to a field of mud. But each time we've played, I've fallen in love with it more and more. Last year, Florence + The Machine were booked in the same slot as you, but they ended up headlining when Dave Grohl broke his leg. You must be hoping that Adele watches her step over the next few days... Ha! Absolutely. We'd certainly be the most... what's the word? The most confusing headliner ever. Are you looking forward to Adele's set? I think everyone is... I'm not even English and I feel like it's going to be a religious moment for me. You know what I mean? She's England's girl. She's royalty. Given your affection for the festival, do you feel like you have to do something special for your set? I do, I do. We've already put the wheels in motion. But you have to balance doing something special, a one-off, with the nerves of messing that up and ruining the whole show. Self-described \"ginger little cookie,\" Frances is being tipped as one of this year's breakthrough acts, thanks to heart-rending piano ballads like Don't Worry About Me and Grow. She plays the Pussy Parlure stage at 16:30 on Friday. This is your first Glastonbury. What are you expecting? I'm expecting chaos. I'm expecting it to be a completely different world. Are you staying in a tent or the tourbus? I'm actually staying in a hotel! Oh, how posh. I know! But I get back from Australia the day before\u2026 and it's also my birthday on the Monday, so it's like my birthday treat. I'll start the celebrations watching Coldplay on the Sunday. What should people expect from your set? Well, I've been touring with a keyboard since I was 16 and just recently I've got my own proper, big girl's piano. So that's very exciting. But I just want it to be a nice, relaxing little introduction for people that might not have heard me before. What's the best, or the strangest, reaction you've had so far? I played at Wilderness festival last year and people started doing contemporary dance - this sort of capoeira stuff - in the crowd. It was very nice, but it was pretty distracting. Husband and wife Phoebe Bates and Christopher Anaspitos will spend most of Glastonbury 11 metres off the ground, performing their high-wire show Equilibrius. When they're not in mid-air, the couple also give classes in circus skills and invite fans to their caravan for a cup of tea. What can you tell us about Equilibrius? It's paying homage to traditional wire-walking and high-wire skills throughout the ages, but with a contemporary twist - there's a theatrical storyline about how we met and hopefully a few laughs, too. How do you pay homage to your predecessors? Those with a keen eye will notice my wife Phoebe stepping into buckets, which is a reference to Maria Spelterini, who crossed over the Niagra Falls in the 1800s wearing cherry baskets strapped to her feet. How dangerous is it to perform an act like this in Glastonbury's notoriously inclement weather? We train in different weather conditions, so we know what our limits are. There's always an element of risk, but I'd be lying if I said I thought it was dangerous. What's your top tip when you're training people to walk the wire? What I find is that depending on the body that you've got, certain tricks will be easier. So it's easier for me to mount a unicycle on a slack rope than to do a backflip on a tight wire. Wait... Neither of those sound easy Easy might be the wrong word - but certainly more achievable. It's a shorter path to success! What's your greatest Glastonbury experience? There's so many! But it was probably when I did the Arcadia show in 2010, and I walked across a wire 11 metres in the air, near one of those flaming gas jets, and there were about 8,000 to 10,000 people in the field. It was a very simple walk, but the feeling of arriving at the other end of the wire, with the huge cheer from all those people, is something that reverberates in your soul. With a back catalogue that includes Time After Time, Girls Just Wanna Have Fun and True Colours, Cyndi Lauper's set on the Acoustic Stage is sure to be a highlight of the festival. The singer will also perform songs from her new album, the country-tinged Detour. This is your first Glastonbury. Are you looking forward to it? Hell yeah, I'm excited! I was with Boy George in the States and he said: 'You're going to have so much fun' so I'm really looking forward to it. Do you know what to expect? There's a lot of camping and it's going to rain on Thursday, so bring your galoshes. And will you be sticking around to see some of the other acts? I won't be able to see some of the people I'd love to see, because I'm on tour. I think I'm playing on Sunday, so I can't see the people on Saturday like Squeeze or Madness and Adele. That stage is pretty slamming. Tell us about how you came to record a country album in Nashville? When you first come out, and you're famous, your job is being famous, I guess. You have to stay on the hamster wheel. Everything you might want to do, people are like: 'Don't do that, it'll ruin your career!' At this point, it's like how many times can you be ruined? It's never too late to do what you want. On Saturday night at The Park stage, an orchestra conducted by Charles Hazlewood will perform Philip Glass's Symphony No 4, which is based on Bowie's Heroes LP. The performance will be accompanied by a light show designed by artist Chris Levine, who has worked with Massive Attack, Grace Jones and Sigur Ros - as Charles explains. For people who've never heard the Philip Glass Symphony, tell me what it's like. It's a really remarkable piece. Most people have some sense of what Philip Glass's music is like - it's hypnotic, it's repetitive, it's quite kaleidoscopic. And what he did, was he took the essence of Heroes - the essential melodic and harmonic contours of that album - and turned it into a symphony. It's almost like you're experiencing Bowie through a strange, glassy prism. Is it right that you have to wait for Adele to sing her last note before you can strike up the orchestra? Well, absolutely. We don't want to clash with that. So it will be literally at that moment, when all the other stages shut down, that we kick off. There will be something very magical and 'in the midnight hour' about it. I think The Park stage is the perfect place to do it because it's a gorgeous natural amphitheatre. People can just come and lie down, and take in this extraordinary 'son et lumiere' experience. Apparently the light show will be visible right across the site. Look, what I've heard is that, provided it's a relatively clear night, you'll be able to see the light from the moon. So it's literally a Space Oddity! Yeah, I think we can call it that! And do you know what? I feel in my heart this is exactly the kind of thing Bowie would approve of. Quite clearly, by the means and the manner of his passing, he didn't want funerals, he didn't want memorials, he didn't want any of that mawkish rubbish. What he would have liked, I think, would be a big old celebration. A very theatrical, very out-there celebration of what it was he meant to all of us. And so, for me, this is a pitch perfect way of saying we're grateful David Bowie ever existed. Ireland's Roisin Murphy brings her off-kilter, expansive pop music to the West Holts stage at 20:30 on Friday. Expect to hear songs from her Mercury-nominated album Hairless Toys, alongside new music from the forthcoming Take Her Up To Monto. You're something of a Glastonbury veteran... Yeah, I think this might even be my fourth visit to Glastonbury. One time with Moloko, two solo times and back once again like a renegade master. What are your best and worst experiences? The sun setting as we were singing The Time Is Now, the first time I played there, was outstanding. The Ruby Blue set (in 2005) was really difficult because it was just pure muck. It wasn't a pretty sight to look out from the stage and see people all brown and slithering around. You felt pretty sorry for them, to be honest. How do you approach a festival set, compared to one of your own shows? The requirement is to bang 'em out a little bit. It's not the opportunity to teach people about my new record. Unlike a lot of electronic and pop acts, you play with a live band. How important is that? With our band, it's all live. Anything could happen. Anything could go wrong. But it is musicianship. There's a flair to that, which you don't get any other way. You're known for your costumes and elaborate staging. Do you have to scale that down when you're playing a festival? Sometimes festivals aren't really set up for divas like me. My little crew has to set up a tent at the side of the stage to put all my clothes and props in. It's just you and Grace Jones\u2026 Yes, me and Grace Jones causing all the trouble! Guitar pop band Blossoms were all born in the same Stockport hospital, formed in 2013 and have honed their sound by rehearsing in their bassist's grandfather's scaffolding yard. They play The Other Stage on Friday morning, after coming fourth in the BBC's Sound of 2016. This is your Glastonbury debut. What do you expect, having watched it from afar for all these years? It'll just be surreal being there. It'll be like being in the telly. Why should people get out of their tents to see you at 12:30 in the morning? Well, they'll still be quite fresh on a Friday, I'd imagine. If we were playing on a Sunday I might have been a bit worried that nobody would come to watch us. But if the sun's out and we're playing our melodic tunes, it'll be a nice way to start your Friday morning. What's the song that goes down best in your set? Charlemagne's the one. People's heads pop up, like: 'Oh, I know this one'. They've heard it subliminally. That catchy riff has gone into their head. Will you be staying in a tent or a tourbus? We'll be on a bus with beds, which is only a recent addition. Paint me a picture of that bus. To be honest, it's got a chilled vibe. And you can make some toast, which is fun when you're flying down the motorway. The Sonic Stage is dedicated to Britain's burgeoning Grime scene on Friday, with sets from the likes of Stormzy, Section Boyz, Charlie Sloth and J Hus. At the top of the bill is Kano, one the genre's original and most distinctive voices, who'll be playing songs from his critically-acclaimed new album, Made In The Manor. Your album is so heavily rooted in East London - how will it feel performing it in a field down the road from Stonehenge? Well, we'll find out! But what I've seen at the festivals I've done already, is everyone embraces it. Sometimes I'm on stage rapping about roads in East London and I hear people singing the lyrics back and I wonder: 'Why do you identify with this so much?' I think it's two things. There's people who are interested in where I'm from, and it gives them a peak into my house, so to speak. And there's people who say: 'Do you know what? It's exactly like where I live'. So people from Birmingham and Manchester and all those inner city places just really embrace it. This is the first time Grime has taken over a stage at Glastonbury - does it feel like a watershed moment? Do you know what? It does feel like a real moment. I remember playing Glastonbury about 10 years ago and it was mainly indie bands, with a little section of rap. I remember people would try and spit on an Arctic Monkeys beat to try and do something the audience would recognise. Now you look at this line-up and you feel like: 'Wow, we really have arrived'. It's been a massive year for us. So yeah, it's a proud moment. You joined Gorillaz on stage when they headlined in 2010. What was that like? It's just crazy. It's just like a sea of people. Oh man, the emotion and the energy is like nothing you've ever, ever felt before. Gorillaz' frontman Damon Albarn is playing with the Orchestra of Syrian Musicians on Friday, too. Will you try to hook up with him? Yeah, I'll try. I think I'll be doing a song with them. So I should be performing twice that day. To quote one of your own songs back at you, do you think it'll be \"t-shirt weather in the manor\" this weekend? I'm hoping so. I wouldn't put money on it. But my venue's a tent so if it rains, it'll get even busier. So I'm glad if it rains, man! Garage rock trio The Bay Rays were formed in Kent just last year. But their debut single Four Walls and its follow-up, New Home, have blasted onto radio thanks to their combination of dynamic riffs and melodic harmonies. They headline the BBC Introducing stage on Sunday. Frontman Harry Nicoll can hardly believe his luck. What were you doing this time last year? This time last year, we were playing small cover gigs in local pubs, just to try and raise money to make some demos and buy a van that could get us on the road. How did you go from a covers band to headlining a stage at Glastonbury in just 12 months? I really don't know! We worked quite hard. We started with a bass player that didn't really know how to play bass - but he learned to play 30 songs in a week so we could do some gigs. From that, we seemed to pick up the knowledge of how to put songs together. For people who haven't heard you, what's the music like? We're just writing about everyday life, really. There's only three of us and it's quite a simple sound. There's a bit of a glam feel - but there just seems to be something about it that resonates. You're on at the same time as Coldplay - so why should people choose you over Chris Martin? Well, everyone knows what Coldplay are about, because they've been around for a while. If you want to see something fresh and exciting and new, the Introducing stage nurtures that. How nervous are you, on a scale of totally calm to permanently on the verge of throwing up? At the moment, I'm fairly nonchalant. But I know that at the time, I'm going to be quaking in my boots. US folk-rock trio Lumineers hit it big in 2012 with songs like Ho Hey and Stubborn Love. Their debut album went platinum on both sides of the Atlantic, with President Obama declaring himself a fan, and they became a firm favourite on the live circuit. Frontman Wesley Schultz tells us what to expect from their Glastonbury return. When you first played Glastonbury in 2013 you jumped off stage and played a song in the middle of the audience. What do you remember about that? We had just flown in, so I don't know what time it was in my body and mind but I remember feeling like it was all dreamlike. We were just going off instinct and muscle memory. We'd never played in front of that many people at that point. It was just an unbelievable high. Had you heard of the festival before you played? We had heard about it through friends but we didn't know what to expect. We had never heard of wellies! Even the flags reminded me of watching Braveheart. You felt like you were removed from the present day. How has the set list evolved now the second album's out? You must be pleased to be playing new material. You can say that again! We used to love festivals because we barely had enough songs to fill 45 minutes! But it's just been really wonderful to turn the page and have all this new material to draw from. Does that mean you won't be doing any more covers? Sometimes we cover Bob Dylan's Subterranean Homesick Blues. We used to play that in little bars, where they'd pay us next to nothing, but it'd be free food and beer. Subterranean Homesick Blues was one that got everyone's attention for a minute. Everyone would stop and say: 'I wonder if they're going to remember all the words?' At festival it's really important that you take that into account, because there's a lot of people that may never see you again. So you think: 'How are we going to make them stay for one more song?' There's a tradition of people dressing up at Glastonbury. What would you like to see as you look out at the crowd? Of all the people in our band, Jerry is the only one who has a signature look. He's like a superhero, he always has to wear the same thing every day. So if people wear some braces and a white shirt, we'll know they're Lumineers fans, so that would be cool.", "text": ["Headliners", "Adele", ",", "Coldplay", "and", "Muse", "will", "rock", "the",

\"has been terminated and removed from office\". But Democrats said he was fired because the FBI was investigating alleged links between the Trump campaign and Russia. The move came as it emerged Mr Comey gave inaccurate information about Mrs Clinton's emails to Congress last week. Reaction as it happened James Comey: From 'brave' to fired Decoding Comey's testimony President Trump wrote in a letter to Mr Comey that he agreed with US Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recommendation that \"you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau\". Mr Sessions said the Department of Justice was \"committed to a high level of discipline, integrity, and the rule of law\", and \"a fresh start is needed\". The White House said the search for a successor would begin immediately. Mr Comey was addressing FBI agents in Los Angeles when he was handed a note by one of his team informing him he had just been fired. The 56-year-old - who was four years into his 10-year term as FBI director - reportedly laughed, thinking it was a prank. Many have expressed surprise that Mr Comey should be fired for his handling of the Clinton emails investigation, given that Mr Trump formerly praised the FBI director's conduct in the matter. In the final days of the presidential campaign, Mr Trump told a rally it \"took guts\" for Mr Comey to reopen the inquiry. \"What he did brought back his reputation,\" Mr Trump said. But on Tuesday, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said he \"cannot defend the Director's handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton's emails, and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgement that he was mistaken\". \"Almost everyone agrees the Director made serious mistakes; it is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspectives\". He said Mr Comey had been wrong to \"usurp\" the previous attorney general in July 2016 to announce the Clinton emails inquiry should be closed without prosecution. The deputy attorney general said Mr Comey compounded his error by \"gratuitously\" releasing \"derogatory information\" about Mrs Clinton. Democrats swiftly suggested that Mr Trump had fired Mr Comey to influence the FBI inquiry into Russian whether members of the Trump election campaign colluded with the Kremlin. The House of Representatives and Senate intelligence committees are investigating the same allegations. \"Were these investigations getting too close to home for the president?\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer asked a Tuesday evening press conference. \"This does not seem to be a coincidence,\" he added. And it is not just Democrats who expressed concern. Richard Burr, the Republican head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said: \"I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Jim Comey's termination.\" The development is drawing comparisons with the so-called Saturday Night Massacre of 1973, when President Richard Nixon fired an independent special prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal. But President Trump has repeatedly insisted the Russia allegations are \"fake news\". Donald Trump and senior Justice Department officials are framing the firing of James Comey as a result of his botched investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server. They do so using language that even Clinton backers would probably support. Democrats, to put it bluntly, aren't buying it, however - not from this White House. They are dismissing this Clinton explanation as a smokescreen, and view the suddenness of the move as an attempt to subvert the ongoing FBI investigation into possible ties between Russia and the Trump campaign. At the very least, their calls for an independent investigation into the matter will become deafening - and some Republicans may now be inclined to agree. The president didn't help his cause by specifically asserting that he was \"not under investigation\" in his letter to Mr Comey. Already Democrats are clamouring for the ex-director to testify before Congress about the state of the FBI's Russia investigation at the time of his dismissal. Just days after becoming president, Mr Trump shook Mr Comey's hand at a White House event and said \"he's become more famous than me\". That may have been an exaggeration at the time. It seems less like one now. Read Anthony's full take Mr Comey has been criticised by Democrats for the handling of his investigation into whether Mrs Clinton's use of a private email server when secretary of state compromised national security. The now-former FBI director made two interventions during the 2016 election campaign to make pronouncements about the investigation. He said in July the case should be closed without prosecution, but then declared - 11 days before November's election - that he had reopened the inquiry because of a discovery of a new trove of Clinton-related emails. He told the Senate last week it made him \"mildly nauseous\" to think his intervention could have affected the election, but insisted he would make the same decision again. Mrs Clinton blames Mr Comey for her shock election defeat last November to Donald Trump. What was Clinton FBI probe about? Mr Comey told the Senate Judiciary Committee on 3 May that Mrs Clinton's top aide, Huma Abedin, had forwarded \"hundreds and thousands\" of emails, \"some of which contain classified information\", to her then-husband. But the FBI conceded on Tuesday that Ms Abedin had only sent two email chains containing classified information to her husband, Anthony Weiner, for printing. The clarification was made in a letter from the FBI's assistant director of congressional affairs, Gregory Brower, to the congressional committee. The majority of the 49,000 emails investigators uncovered on Mr Weiner's laptop were transferred via automatic backup of her work Blackberry device, Mr Brower wrote. Ultimately, all 12 classified email chains found on Mr Weiner's device were duplicates that had already been reviewed by investigators.", "text": ["The", "White", "House", "shocked", "Washington",

Not, that is, as a result of the bank's relatively limited activities in America. Rather, the bank stands accused of hiding transactions for \"Iranian financial institutions\" that were subject to US economic sanctions. The bank denies the allegations. The case is just the latest example of how the US has been extending its so-called extraterritorial powers in recent years - where the US has been flexing its legal muscle outside its own territory. \"The issue boils down to the following concept,\" says Jacob Frenkel, chair of securities enforcement, white-collar crime and government investigations practice with the law firm Shulman, Rogers, Gandal, Pordy & Ecker. \"Any sovereign, whether a country, province, state or municipality, has a right to expect that a company or person doing business in that territory is subject to the laws of that territory. \"Just as a party doing business enjoys the protection of the laws, so too must a party comply with the laws.\" That definition raises two further questions. First, how should \"doing business in that territory\" be defined? In other words, when is an individual or firm deemed to be doing business in the US? It does not take much, according to David Pitofsky, a member of law firm Goodwin Procter's litigation department, who is currently involved in client work connected to the Libor scandal, and is representing the administrator of the Gulf Coast Claims Facility, which deals with claims from victims of the Deep Water Horizon oil spill. \"As long as dollars are involved, they will eventually touch a US institution,\" he says, referring to how almost all banking transactions, particularly in US dollars, will at some point in the process flow through the Federal Reserve Bank in New York. The courts have made clear over the years that such flows of funds through New York is sufficient for asserting jurisdiction. \"Even if a transaction is done, say, in Japanese yen, if a blip in the system turns these into dollars - however briefly - that in theory could mean it falls under US law,\" says Mr Pitofsky. American patent lawyers are also eagerly eyeing activities abroad. \"Through both judicial and legislative efforts, US patent law has evolved from a strict territorial based set of laws asserting jurisdiction only over those infringements taking place on American soil,\" according to University of Alberta professors Moin Yahya and Cameron Hutchison. US patent law, they say, has expanded into \"a more expansive set of rules asserting jurisdiction over any event that may harm patent holders in the United States regardless of where the infringement is taking place\". \"This, we argue, is contrary to the original purpose of patent law and inconsistent with American obligations under the International Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property,\" they write in a paper. Another example of how the US legal system is extending its tentacles abroad is the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, a controversial piece of legislation that provides for extraterritorial jurisdiction for US courts over actions brought where US investors or markets are harmed by actions outside the United States. Dodd-Frank, with its numerous registration and clearing requirements and its ongoing revisions, has caused considerable legislative uncertainty in a number of financial markets. The act has resulted in particular concern among players in the so-called over-the-counter derivatives markets, which include interest-rate, currency or commodity swaps that are used by companies in a wide range of sectors to reduce investment, currency and trading risk. \"We have a rule that's being extended beyond its original scope, and that's concerning,\" says Don Thompson, managing director and associate general counsel at JP Morgan in New York. The second question raised by Mr Frenkel's definition of what the issue relates to is should non-US individuals and companies be bound by US law even when they operate outside the US, simply because they also do some business in America? According to US anti-corruption laws, they should. Two examples illustrate how such laws are increasingly used to target activities that take place in other parts of the world. The media tycoon Rupert Murdoch's US-based global media group News Corporation is co-operating with the US Department of Justice (DoJ) which is looking into possible breaches of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The DoJ is examining allegations its now defunct UK newspaper subsidiary News of the World paid UK officials for information, something prohibited by the Act. In 2010, industrial group Daimler, the owner of Mercedes-Benz, pleaded guilty in the US to corruption charges after admitting to paying tens of millions of dollars in bribes to government officials in at least 22 countries. The bribes were not paid in the US, yet the German company agreed to pay US authorities $185m (\u00c2\u00a3118m) to settle the case. Similarly, back in 2008 the German industrial group Siemens paid $800m to settle a US investigation into bribes paid to government officials in Argentina, Bangladesh, Iraq and Venezuela. Individuals have also been targeted. In 2009, Gary Kaplan, the boss of London-based gambling company BetOnSports, fell foul of a US law that bans Americans from placing bets online even on websites outside the US. He was jailed for four years. In 2006, three British former NatWest bankers were extradited to the US to face fraud charges, in a case sparking anger in the UK business community. At the time, the bankers said their crimes had taken place in the UK and the victim was a UK bank hence they wanted to be tried in Britain. But the US authorities said their actions had been linked to the collapse of the energy giant Enron and as such it was a US matter. And earlier this year, retired UK businessman Christopher Tappin was extradited to the US on charges of exporting parts for Iranian missiles. In fact, the US is tightening its sanctions against Iran, and thus the potential for legal action against anyone trading with the country - and not just those doing deals that would aid it in building a nuclear reactor. Earlier this month, US Congress voted to impose sanctions that meant anyone who provided commercial goods, technology or financial services to Iran's energy sector could face punishment. Critics of the international reach of US legislation do not necessarily disagree with US ambitions, which range from protecting the global financial system to curbing the nuclear or military ambitions of a number of dictatorships. But companies, whether in the financial services sector or in industry or elsewhere, do object to the one-sided approach of US legislation, pointing to a lack of reciprocity that would allow other countries' legal systems to also cover US firms. That, however, is \"an issue for the 'affected' sovereign\", according to Mr Frenkel. \"There is nothing that prevents other sovereigns from adopting laws and courts of other sovereigns from enforcing laws as sweeping and with the breadth of US enforcement programs. That becomes an issue of sovereign willpower and allocation of enforcement resources.\" Non-US critics have also vented their anger in instances where they deem US rulings unfair. And many complain about the increased complexity of doing business, both within and outside the US. The thicket of new regulations has the potential to create an uneven playing field in international markets, according to Dan Cohen, managing director and head of government relations for the Depository Trust and Clearing Corp, a non-commercial co-operative that serves as the primary post-trade infrastructure organisation for US capital markets. Moreover, it could impede global regulatory co-operation and undermine efforts to increase market transparency and mitigate risk in the over-the-counter derivatives market, he says. Others point to the added complexities for companies required to deal with the vast and growing number of regulatory bodies in the US. Not only will they have to comply with the rules of federal bodies such as the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, there are also state bodies, such as The New York State Department of Financial Services, which is the regulator that accused Standard Chartered. It is 10 months old and supervises some 4,500 institutions with assets of about $6.2 trillion. Yet many had not even heard of it until this week.", "text": ["The", "question", "is", "pertinent", "and", "timely", ",", "given", "that", "Standard", "Chartered", ",", "a", "UK", "bank", ",", "was",

Rabin's assassination was one of the most successful political killings of the 20th Century; his assassin, Yigal Amir, wanted to destroy the Israel-Palestinian Oslo peace accords by shooting dead the only Israeli leader who had a chance of making it work. Amir wanted to stop Israel ceding land in the occupied West Bank to Palestinian control; he believed the land was a gift from God to the Jewish people that could never be traded away. He achieved his objectives. The Israeli official argued that Rabin's successors were just as willing to talk. They couldn't make a deal, he argued, as neither Yasser Arafat nor his successor Mahmoud Abbas would make the necessary compromises for peace. Rabin's killer, a religious Jew and law student in his 20s, was convinced that he had scored an historic victory. When he was charged with the murder, Amir admitted cheerfully that he had done it. He asked for a glass of schnapps so he could toast his achievement. The atmosphere in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories in the months leading up to Rabin's assassination on 4 November 1995 was turbulent; a mixture of hope, among supporters of peace on both sides, and fear and loathing on the Israeli right-wing and within the Palestinian militants of Hamas. I moved to Jerusalem in August 1995 to start a posting as the BBC Middle East correspondent. Wherever you went in Israeli West Jerusalem there were posters of Yitzhak Rabin, put there by Israeli opponents of the interim peace deals he had agreed with the Palestinians. In many of them, Rabin was made to look like Yasser Arafat, complete with a black-and-white Palestinian scarf, the keffiyeh, folded around his head in the Arafat style. In some posters, waved at demonstrations, Israeli enemies of Rabin portrayed him as a Nazi, in the black uniform of the SS. Benjamin Netanyahu - then leader of the opposition, now prime minister - spoke at some of the most vitriolic anti-Rabin rallies. Among the Palestinians, militants in Hamas had already started a suicide bomb campaign. They would have nothing to do with Oslo, saying it was surrender and that there could be no territorial compromise with an Israeli state they believed should not exist. Some leading intellectuals rejected it too. But my impression in the summer of 1995 was that mainstream Palestinians and Israelis had real hope that better times were coming, that there could be a peaceful resolution of the most intractable conflict of modern times. The extremists, though they were kicking and screaming, were being outmanoeuvred. Yitzhak Rabin was the vital Israeli if peace was to be made. He was the man Israelis trusted most with their security. Rabin had been a leading commander in Israel's independence war in 1948-49. In 1967, as chief of staff, Israel's most senior general, he led their armed forces to their most decisive victory over their Arab enemies. In six days, Israel destroyed the armed forces of Jordan, Egypt and Syria. After that, like many Israeli generals, he had gone into politics. Once the Oslo peace process started, he put his weight behind it in the Knesset, Israel's parliament, and internationally. This was a typical quote, from a speech in 1993: \"I, serial number 30743, Lieutenant General in reserves Yitzhak Rabin, a soldier in the Israel Defense Forces and in the army of peace, I, who have sent armies into fire and soldiers to their death, say today: We sail onto a war which has no casualties, no wounded, no blood nor suffering. It is the only war which is a pleasure to participate in - the war for peace.\" Israelis listened to Rabin when he talked about making peace, because he had proved himself in uniform as a man who above all wanted his country to be secure. They listened when he said peace, not war, was the answer. Public grief overflowed in Israel after Rabin was murdered. There was plenty of guilt too, from supporters of peace who realised that they had not defended Rabin enough when he was under verbal assault. Of course it is impossible to map out with certainty an alternative future for Israelis and Palestinians had Rabin lived. The Oslo peace process had a slow death, but I believe it contracted its fatal illness on 4 November 1995 when Yigal Amir shot Yitzhak Rabin in the back. There was a chance of peace with the Palestinians when Rabin was alive. He was forging an unlikely understanding with Yasser Arafat, his detested old enemy. Arafat visited Leah, Rabin's widow, in Tel Aviv after the assassination to offer his condolences, and was pictured without his trademark keffiyeh. It still might not have worked. On 4 November 1995, the night Rabin was shot dead, talks with the Palestinians were behind schedule. Rabin himself had not stated publicly that he supported the idea of a Palestinian state, though his closest aides said after his death that he knew it would be part of a final settlement. The negotiators had not got yet touched the hardest items on the agenda of any peace deal: the final borders of a Palestinian state, the future of Jerusalem, of Palestinian refugees, and of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. But between them, Rabin and Arafat might have seized the chance to make history. Shimon Peres was sworn in as prime minister after the assassination. Instead of calling a snap election to capitalise on a surge in the polls he decided to see out the government's term. A succession of blunders followed, and so did an intensification of the Hamas suicide bombings. On election night in 1996, Israelis went to bed thinking that Shimon Peres had secured a narrow victory over Benjamin Netanyahu. At the Likud campaign headquarters in Tel Aviv, I saw Israeli right-wingers weeping over their hero's defeat. But when Israel woke, the final votes had given victory to Mr Netanyahu and the right. Yitzhak Rabin would most likely have beaten Mr Netanyahu. The future would have been different. Yigal Amir is still in jail, convinced he is a national hero, campaigning for a pardon. He was allowed to marry and fathered a son during a conjugal visit. The boy's ritual circumcision was held at Rimonim prison, 12 years to the day after the assassination. Amir attended in handcuffs. As the 20th anniversary of the killing approached, right-wing Israeli fans of the Beitar Jerusalem football team chanted his name from the terraces.", "text": ["My", "view", "is", "that", "Rabin",

being allowed to stay up late and to those of more grizzled vintage watching in boozy clubhouses? Neither side will want to slip up - knowing only two qualify from Pool A which also includes Australia. Different stories, different lives, different backgrounds. All brought together by one match. And the expectation, and nerves, and tension\u2026 There are two facets to watching George as a parent: there's me, high on adrenaline, and there's his mother Jan, high on fear. The pure adrenaline kicks in for me at 6am. I don't need a drink. It still feels amazing to me, even now he's 23 and with 51 caps. The joy is still fresh. Every game he runs out you can't believe it's happening. I remember going to Twickenham with George when he was nine to watch the Heineken Cup final. During the match he decided he wanted to learn to whistle properly, with two fingers in his mouth, so he could get involved. To my great regret I taught him. It was all I heard all the way back home to Anglesey. Going to Twickenham can feel like going to the Stade de France. It's out of town, a train or metro ride away. It can be sterile, whereas the Millennium Stadium - well, the memory of that night in 2013 when we took England's championship and Six Nations title is electric. And after the Grand Slam win in 2012, we walked back from the players' hotel at 5am and it was still going strong on the streets of Cardiff. Saturday night is all about expectation for me. For Wales, this is our cup final. If we get this right, it's onwards and upwards. I saw George and the boys last weekend, and all the talk was about this match. They have it in them to win this week but whatever happens, we'll all walk away from it. It's not like football - somebody will be upset, but we'll all get on afterwards. With our proximity to the border, in the old days when Wales was a dry country on Sundays we used to get busloads of them turning up in Lydney. They would run off with our women and then we would run after them and a few fights would ensue. But that's all changed now. The local banter has always been there. Before the inception of leagues we used to play Welsh clubs on Wednesday nights, and it was always hard but fair. The hospitality was fantastic. We'll have 150 people down on Saturday night, with the big screen up in the clubhouse. Beer and cider and lager, pasties and chips. Like most clubs we'll have a happy hour early in the evening and then maybe another at 10pm, depending on what's happened at Twickenham. It'll be a hell of an atmosphere. 8pm and alcohol are not the ideal partners, but the one certainty with rugby crowds is that it doesn't lead to anything silly. There'll be Welshmen there on Saturday night. There's always Welshmen there. At least, they're Welsh when they're winning. It's going to be huge. Had I been doing the road race at the World Championships this weekend, I would have been watching the match on my laptop in a hotel room in Virginia. I'd investigated streaming options, and it was definitely possible - French cyclist Tony Gallopin tweeted a photo of him watching France v Italy in the same scenario - but it might have lacked a little atmosphere. Instead, with my season having ended after the Vuelta because of exhaustion, I've pulled off a rather decent silver lining: a ticket for Twickenham. And because my season has been over for more than a week now, my drinking form has come back a treat. By Saturday it'll be at its peak. Great timing. I've never been to Twickenham before. During the Six Nations I'm away in Belgium and northern France, racing the Spring Classics, so all my trips to the Millennium Stadium are during the autumn internationals. It's going to be immense. As a kid growing up in Cardiff, England are always the rivals you pretend to be beating - when you're on your bike, when you're playing in the year eight rugby team at school. But it's a good rivalry: fun, not bitter, added spice rather than actual hatred. It may well be too nerve-wracking to fully enjoy. When my fiance Sara watches me race it's the same thing: the only bit she can enjoy are the last few seconds when she knows I'm OK. I'm staying down for the night so I'll have to get my tactics right; it might help to numb the pain if you get blind drunk, but it would be sad if you couldn't remember a historic triumph. Perhaps the way to do it is to pace things to half-time and then, if it's all going south, get on the gins. What achievement would I give up for a Wales win? Not a top 10 in the Tour de France. I'd take the top 10 and an England win on Saturday, but only if we can then meet again in the final and beat them. Beating England, at Twickenham, in a World Cup final? Nothing would be better. My first match at Twickenham, aged 10, was the Erica Roe one in 1982. My dad got permission from my mum to take me and my big brother; there we were, virtually on the front row, and Erica streaked across the pitch. You tend to be quite fond of rugby when you've seen that as a 10-year-old boy. This time I'm setting off from Essex at 10am. There are lots of us going up from Burnham Rugby Club, so we'll have a steak lunch in Richmond, watch the Springboks v Samoa match in a bar and then hook up with the rest of the Burnham lads. This game is huge. Apart from the Aussies, no-one hates us more than Wales. They don't care about anything else than beating England, and that passion is unmatched - especially against England. When you see the Welsh team singing their national anthem, you can guarantee that 30% of them will be crying. I've never seen an English player cry. That's our greatest fear - that they will want to beat us like no-one else. Equally, man for man, they don't have what they had. Injuries have hurt them. We should be too strong. I don't have a great record against Wales - I was at Twickenham in 2012 when they beat us - but my levels of optimism going into this one are pretty high. It is a must-win game, because we do not want to be going into the Australia game on Saturday week having to get a win. Let's beat Wales, and then treat the Wallabies as the bonus. This match feels even bigger than the Six Nations decider in Cardiff in 2013. Any England v Wales contest captures the nation's imagination in Wales, because it is little brother against big brother, and in the big brother's back yard, but you get the sense outside the country that this is as high profile as it's ever been anywhere else too. It's bigger than the World Cup quarter-final I played in back in 2003. It's in England, rather than Brisbane; it's on a Saturday night, at prime time; there's been almost a two-year build-up since the draw was made. Everyone's diary for Saturday has shut down for months. And there are huge implications for both teams if they lose. The sense of anti-climax for the defeated side will be devastating. In 2003 there was no expectation on us. We were a young team in transformation, with lots of old stalwarts retiring and youngsters taking their place. This time there is expectation on both sides now - Wales because they reached the semi-finals four years ago, England because it is their tournament and they are playing at Twickenham. Come Saturday night it'll be one of those 'where were you?' moments. Wales will come to a standstill. There will be special screenings at clubs, whole families coming over to watch it at relatives' houses, kids being allowed to stay up late. I'm actually very jealous of the players. Any ex-pro would be, because these are the sort of games you dream about. It is an absolute privilege to play in a match that matters as much as this one. The Welsh injuries have been devastating, but it does mean we can go into it as underdogs - and Welsh teams are better as underdogs. All the pressure will be on England, and pressure can do funny things to you in sport, both inspire you to unbelievable acts and limit you hugely. The tension will be palpable. This is a once-in-a-lifetime game. You won't get this match in this competition in this country for 20 or 30 years, if at all. That's how big it is. We'll be watching it at school, on the big screen in the main theatre. We did it for the Fiji game but the atmosphere for this one will be much bigger - I'm a day pupil, but I'll be staying on to watch it. We've got a home game against Bryanston in the afternoon. We've also got three Welshmen in the team, one of whom is particularly vocal. Those three will be wearing their Wales shirts in the evening; lots of us will be wearing England shirts. All of us will be singing the anthems. When the three ex-Millfield guys - Robshaw, Mako Vunipola and Jonathan Joseph - were on the pitch last Friday there was a definite extra buzz in the theatre. It makes it all so real for you. Chris Robshaw came to watch our game against RGS Wycombe last year, and he was great - he said hello to everyone. I was also lucky enough to meet Sam Burgess at Bath last season; his enthusiasm was brilliant, and he would talk to anyone. As a player his record speaks for itself. It's a massive match. That defeat in Cardiff a few years ago really hurt a lot of us, and we're desperate to beat them. This is our 142nd season as a club. We were founder members of the Welsh Rugby Union, and it'll be rocking down here on Saturday night. We're laying on enough free curry for 100 people, which is something we do for every Wales game. We're showing every single match in the tournament here. The 8pm kick-off is an interesting one. That's a long old day. You know what rugby fellows are like once they get a taste. All our teams playing that day will come back to the clubhouse. The Firsts are playing away at Forgeside but there's plenty of time to get back. The whole town will be out for it. The ones I feel sorry for are the youth team and their parents - they've got a tournament on Sunday morning that's an hour's drive away. It took 20 years after my first Five Nations match in Cardiff to see an England v Wales match. It wasn't out of choice - whenever England would come to town, so would my godfather from London and various relatives from west Wales. And because a ticket for that match was considered too precious for a child, the adults would always take it. I went to Scotland games, Ireland, France, but never England. That's how big this fixture is. Welsh fans like the negatives more than positives, which may be just as well. We've been the gallant losers for the past five years, losing to almost everyone by a point or two at some stage. And we're definitely not favourites again, although that might free Wales up. If England play decently then Wales are going to struggle. If you took each nation's best XV it would be extremely close, but the next XV England could put out would smash Wales' - and with all our injuries we're significantly into that already. But I'll be travelling full of hope, if also level-headed. I'm planning to meet a couple of the boys for a steak and chips and beers in Teddington at 5pm, then head down to the ground for a couple of beers beforehand. The 8pm kick-off makes it a marathon, not a sprint.", "text": ["What", "will", "it", "mean", "to", "the", "two", "nations", "-", "to", "those", "lucky", "enough", "to", "have", "tickets", ",", "to",

Believe me, that is a good result, compared to some other teams. Russian fans have to criss-cross the country, clocking up around 1,200 miles. Northern Ireland fans are simply going in reasonably straight line, heading north from Nice to Paris, with a stop in the middle. Fans are going to need patience and plenty of euros. 12 June - Nice: Northern Ireland v Poland 16 June - Lyon: Northern Ireland v Ukraine 21 June - Paris: Northern Ireland v Germany Fail to prepare, prepare to fail. There is a huge amount of information already available for travelling fans on the UEFA website. So fill your boots. Or as they say in France, remplissez vos bottes. Anyone who has been to France knows most people you encounter in the big cities can speak English, but it would do no harm to brush up on your French if you can. After all, if Northern Ireland get to the final, you will be there most of the summer. The tournament kicks off for Northern Ireland in sunny Nice on Sunday 12 June, and if you are not going, or could not get a ticket, please stop reading now. The city ticks every box - the sun, sea, sand and the stadium. All you could ask for and more. Very nice indeed. Ok, it is a pity it does not have more seats - only 35,000. In fact, it is the smallest ground at which Northern Ireland will play, but the fans are very close to the pitch and the atmosphere promises to be spine-tingling. Bring your trunks, or your bikini. The fanzone is right beside the Mediterranean, at the seafront in the centre of Nice. It holds about 10,000 fans and buses will go from here to the stadium on match day. The stadium is relatively close to the city centre, and only four miles from the airport. It is perfect for a day-trip and that is what many fans are planning to do. One bit of advice - watch your wallets and purses. Pickpockets love crowds and they also tend to love Nice. It is time to fold away your towel, rub in some after-sun cream and head to Lyon for the second game on Thursday 16 June. By train, it is reasonably straight forward, by road it is quite a trek. About five hours in a car, approximately 300 miles and more than 30 euros (\u00a323) in tolls. However, at least that is the travel hassle all over for a while? Oh wait ... Maybe we just caught it on a bad day, but the traffic in Lyon was horrendous. It took more than an hour to crawl from Lyon city centre to the stadium. In fairness, it is an out-of-town stadium. So as the Traffic and Travel folk like to say, 'please leave extra time for your journey'. On the plus side, it is a big, brand new stadium - 58,000 seats - the biggest at which Northern Ireland will play in the group stages. No need for your swimming gear, unless you want to swim in the River Rh\u00f4ne. Actually, forget that, you are not allowed. The fanzone is at the Place Bellecour, right in the heart of the city and has room for 32,000 fans. Lyon is France's third largest city. What is the second largest? Keep reading... All roads lead to Paris. Tuesday 21 June is the final group game. The good news for car drivers is that although it is another 34 euros (\u00a326) in tolls and a four-hour journey, it is a straight road to the capital. Indeed, at one point the Sat Nav (if you're driving, don't forget to pack it) displayed the memorable instruction 'next turn in 188 miles'. If the grass looks particularly green at the Parc des Princes stadium, it is all down to the Ballymena-born groundsman Jonathan Calderwood. For those fortunate to obtain one of the 48,000 seats, the advice is to arrive early. There will be a security cordon around the stadium which will be time-consuming. It will be the same at the other grounds, but Paris being Paris, it is likely to be particularly rigorous. As you can imagine, it is the mother of all fanzones with room for 120,000 people. No prizes for guessing the location - beside the Eiffel Tower. If you cannot find it, your old geography teacher will be ashamed. This is where it gets complicated. Even if Northern Ireland come third in their group, there is a good chance they will qualify for the knockout stages. There is also a reasonable possibility that they could end up back in Lyon. Please do not ask me to explain. Even Carol Vorderman would struggle to work out the Euro knockout venue permutations. Money, phone, sun cream. Oh, and bring along your 'EHIC' card which entitles access to EU health care. France's second largest city is Marseille, and it is hosting one of the semi-finals. It is just along the French coast from Nice. So if Northern Ireland fans are feeling excessively confident, they could leave their suitcases in Nice after the first game, travel light around the rest of France and then pick them up again before the semi-final in Marseille.

sympathisers\". Labour's leader has said bombing is not a sensible way to bring peace to Syria. The BBC's Carole Walker said the PM wanted to win the Commons' backing without having to rely on Labour MPs. Opposition leader Mr Corbyn was forced to offer a free vote to his MPs after a shadow cabinet rebellion. As many as 50 Labour MPs could support David Cameron although party sources have suggested this number is falling as Mr Corbyn seeks to persuade them to listen to his arguments against intervention. Meanwhile, thousands of protesters, led by the Stop the War coalition, have taken to the streets of London for the second time in four days to protest against bombing. The government motion to be voted on would authorise air strikes \"exclusively\" against so-called Islamic State - also known as Isil or Daesh - in Syria, and says the UK government will not deploy troops in \"ground combat operations\". It says military action is \"only one component of a broader strategy\" to tackle IS. According to the BBC's latest research, of the 640 MPs likely to vote, 360 MPs are in favour of the motion while 170 are against. Of the remainder, 20 are \"leaning to\" supporting the government, three are \"leaning against\" while 87 are undecided. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed her party's 54 MPs will be opposing air strikes, saying bombing on its own will not rid the threat of terrorism or bring peace to Syria. The Liberal Democrats have confirmed that their eight MPs will support the government, with the Democratic Unionist Party saying its eight MPs will also back airstrikes. Lib Dem leader Tim Farron has written to party members, saying he is aware many in the party will disagree with the \"difficult\" decision he has made, but he has done so because \"the threat to Britain and our allies is clear\". He wrote: \"I believe it is right to support what is a measured, legal and broad-based international effort to tackle the evil regime that has contributed to the hundreds of thousands of desperate refugees fleeing for their lives.\" Addressing a meeting of the 1922 Conservative backbench committee, Mr Cameron warned that if Tory MPs voted against airstrikes they risked undermining a strong message that the UK was standing alongside its allies, including France and the US - already engaged in military action. The PM's attack on Mr Corbyn - which mirrors comments he first made in his party conference speech in October - was criticised by one Labour MP likely to back airstrikes. Wes Streeting said it was \"not the sort of thing\" he expected to hear from the prime minister. While in recent days the government has been trying to court Labour MPs, the BBC's Carole Walker said it was now apparent Downing Street was keen to carry the vote through a combination of its own MPs and their \"natural allies\", such as the DUP. Mr Corbyn has urged Labour frontbenchers who support airstrikes to \"think again\", saying they are \"not a sensible or rational way forward\" and would \"takes us yet again into another conflict\". In an interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, he said MPs \"must bear in mind what the public think and what the implications are for this country\". More than 75% of Labour members polled by the party had indicated they were opposed to air strikes, he said. Asked about his failure to convince his shadow cabinet to back his position, he said: \"Some people are more difficult to persuade than others, and I look forward to them being persuaded.\" Rather than air strikes, Mr Corbyn said efforts should focus on a political settlement and achieving a \"credible line of government\" across Syria. Asked whether, if he was prime minister, he would urge France and the United States - which are already bombing IS in Syria - to stop, he said: \"I would ask them to put their efforts into a peace process.\" He added: \"I would ask them to join in looking for the way in which we can achieve a political solution to the Syria civil war as the best way forward of solving that problem.\" MPs rejected air strikes against Syrian government targets in 2013, but have since backed strikes against IS in Iraq. Ministers say it is \"illogical\" to carry out strikes in Iraq but not Syria as IS does not recognise the border between the countries. One of the key debating points has been Mr Cameron's claim there are 70,000 moderate ground forces able to fight IS in Syria. The prime minister's spokeswoman said a claim by Labour MP Louise Haigh that the national security adviser had briefed MPs that 30,000 of the 70,000 were \"much more radical Islamists\" was a misrepresentation of what he had said. Ms Haigh made the comment on Twitter, and was challenged by other MPs who had been at the briefing. She later insisted the government must \"be clearer about the make-up\" of the 70,000 figure.", "text": ["The", "prime", "minister", "called", "on", "them", "not", "to", "``", "sit", "on", "their",

overnight news film. 06:00 Up again. At least I had a bed and it was dry, unlike many of the \"umbrella movement\" facing a downpour on the streets. In fact, I almost trip over one of them stretched out on the tarmac with his umbrella across his chest when I arrive for the flag-raising ceremony at Wanchai. 07:00 Queuing for security on the way into the ceremony. There are more police here than I've seen since the tear gas episodes of early Monday morning. Quick photo of the BBC team. We've been joined at the hip since Sunday. I now call producer Maria Byrne \"Maria Poppins\" as we are reporting the \"umbrella movement\" after all and Maria is indefatigably cheerful and has every single thing you could possibly need in her bag: water, rehydration tablets, tangerines, chocolate bars, safety pins, umbrellas, change for the subway\u2026. spoonful of sugar\u2026. actually I don't think there's anything she doesn't have in her bag. If you don't believe me and you're in Hong Kong, flag her down on the street and ask her for something! BBC producers\u2026. a special breed. 08:00 Flag-raising under a lemony sun. Backdrop - Hong Kong's exhilarating skyline of mountains and glass towers. Foreground - two red flags flutter up the flagpoles while a police band playing the Chinese national anthem. Embattled Hong Kong leader CY Leung and dignitaries stand to attention. A mostly elderly crowd of onlookers dressed in red T-shirts and baseball caps wave plastic flags. One of them tells me afterwards that the protestors \"have ulterior motives and are marginal anyway\". 09:00 Back outside the police cordon and the democracy protestors describe how they turned their backs as the flags were being raised to express their disgust at a Hong Kong leader they see as Beijing's man. One girl, with a steady gaze: \"I am a Hong Kong citizen and Chinese as well. I do love my country. I belong to China but not the government.\" Minutes later out march the elderly patriots straight into the tangle of young protesters, and things start getting emotional. One old man shouts that his grandchildren can't go to school because their teachers have been on strike and another accuses the protestors of being immoral and lawless. The latter remind each other to stay calm. Their organisers, insofar as there are any, seem anxious. 10:00 A quick subway ride back to Admiralty and the heart of the demonstration. The main thoroughfare in front of government headquarters looks like a nomad encampment now, with gazebos, plastic sheeting and flags. They're calling it \"democracy square\". I can't see the national flag of China anywhere. It's only the fourth day of this occupation, but already there's a rhythm to the day \u2026 as I arrive volunteers are bagging up rubbish and sorting recycling before the big crowds they expect to arrive later. 11:00 Back to the hotel for breakfast and wifi. I write up the morning's doings and check what's happening in all the places where I'm not\u2026 National Day ceremonies in Beijing, detentions in various Chinese cities of those expressing solidarity with Hong Kong's protests, statements of concern from around the world. 13:00 Maria Poppins says we are going to be up all night and must get some sleep. I lie down but my mind is full. Full of what you ask? Well since you ask\u2026. This is what I'm thinking: Sixty-five years ago today, Chairman Mao told the world \"the people of China have stood up\". But these Hong Kong protestors are people of China too and Mao's successors are telling them to sit down and shut up. The Communist Party has so clearly turned into a party of reaction not revolution. It is the establishment and it knows it and is afraid of people with convictions. Mao also said \"power comes from the barrel of a gun\" and I think his successors would agree. On the mainland it still does. Sixty-five years and counting. They didn't come this far by backing down at the first squeak of protest. But this is not a squeak, it's a mighty roar. How long can Beijing go on claiming these are extremists stirred up by hostile foreign forces? Is the democracy movement now too big to fail? Students, bankers, shop assistants, billionaires... I'm constantly amazed by the strength of conviction here and the depth of support from the general public. I hope someone is telling Xi Jinping the truth about what he's up against. How will this end? Many say they won't back down until CY Leung resigns and Beijing retracts its election rules, but others feel they've already made their point by turning up. They've sent an unmistakable message to Beijing that Hong Kong is not just another Chinese city. 14:00 With all of this racing through my head, I am clearly not going to sleep, so I sit up and write the above. Now time to set off again to witness history in the making\u2026.don't think I'll ever forget 1 October 2014 in Hong Kong.", "text": ["02:00", "Fall", "into", "bed", "after", "editing", "an",

But there are 100 points still available and it is still eminently possible that it can swing back to Hamilton. Hamilton has already recovered a similar gap this season in a similar time - in the four races from Monaco to Austria, he reduced a 43-point deficit to an 11-point one. That's 32 points, only one short of what he needs to do now. We have seen Rosberg have shocking races, such as Monaco, where he just seemed to be completely out of kilter. And we have seen Hamilton have weekends where he just did not seem to be quite at the races - such as Singapore, a track where he would be expected to be very good, but he just didn't quite have it. History also suggests it is a long way from over. In 2007, Hamilton, then at McLaren, was 17 points ahead of Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen with two races to go. There were 10 points for a win. Raikkonen won both races, Hamilton went off in China and, after a scramble at the last race in Brazil, Raikkonen won the title by one point. Hamilton has already been through three of these tight battles - and he has won two of them, in 2008 and 2014. And look at 2010, when Fernando Alonso, then at Ferrari, was leading the Red Bull drivers Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel by eight and 15 points. Hamilton was also in the frame mathematically, but was so far behind he was never going to do it. Everybody thought it would be Webber challenging Alonso, but all of a sudden Vettel came out of nowhere, had a clean race, Webber and Alonso were compromised by their teams fighting against each other and Vettel sneaked the world title. The biggest difference this year is in all those examples there was wider competition, it was not just a fight between two drivers in one dominant team. Mercedes have been so strong and really only Red Bull can challenge them and mix it up with Hamilton and Rosberg, and even then only in unusual circumstances. If Ferrari get it totally right, they could be slightly in the mix, but really Mercedes have to be careful of only two cars. For both drivers, the maths are simple - Hamilton really needs to win all the remaining races; Rosberg needs only to finish second to Hamilton in all of them. That gives both a clear focus. But so many more things can come into it than that. So there is no doubt Rosberg is in the ascendancy. But it is not won until the chequered flag comes down in Abu Dhabi. Rosberg has been consistently repeating a mantra this season - he's just taking it one race at a time and trying to do the best he can on a given weekend. I did the same during my career. Early on, when I was younger, I would look too far ahead when I was in a situation to win a championship. The problem with that is, by looking at the end goal, you lose focus on the day to day. It's effectively the same as the old adage you've got to walk before you can run. If you win the race this weekend, and then the next race and so on, the championship takes care of itself. So don't look at the championship. Look at the races, because they make up the championship. That is effectively what Rosberg has done. I suspect he has realised that, in the past, he maybe has looked too much at the big picture. Hence his very purposeful statements that he is only looking race by race. It's almost like by saying it he is reinforcing that approach in his own mind. F1 is a mind game. And Hamilton also plays mind games with himself. A good example was when he said in a BBC interview in Malaysia that he likes jet lag, that he likes to be \"a bit off time\". That was for his own benefit, as much as ours. Every driver has their own inner battle, and it is about controlling your emotions. This is a high-stakes game. It's a world championship. The best driver in the world, by one measure, is going to be crowned at the end of the year. Don't tell me there is anyone in sport who would not have some nerves in that situation. Everybody does. Fact. One big difference is that Hamilton has been through this several times already - he has been in final-race title deciders in 2007, 2008, 2010, 2014 and 2015. And he's won three of them. By contrast, Rosberg has been in it and got tantalisingly close in 2014, and that's it. He was nowhere in 2015. Adding to the pressure on Rosberg is he is not a silly guy, and he will realise this is probably his best chance. Not only is there unlikely to be another year in which the reliability between the two Mercedes is as skewed in one driver's favour as it has been in Rosberg's this year. But there is also a big rule change coming for 2017 and there is no guarantee Mercedes will have the same advantage. So he will want to get this one over the line. You may well be wondering how much harder it gets to stick to that race-by-race approach as the season comes to its climax. It builds up the longer the season goes on, but it's really only at the last race when it really starts to take its toll. It comes down to the critical points - qualifying and the start. Those are the highest-risk moments of the weekend, in terms of making a mistake in qualifying or the problems Hamilton, particularly, has had with the starts this year. That's where you can end up in a compromising position and once you're behind and having to make up ground you have to take additional risks. It's only at the last race that the \"taking it race-by-race approach\" starts to become more difficult. Because this is the day, the race. In two hours' time you can be world champion, or not. A great example of that was Carlos Reutemann in Las Vegas in 1981. The Argentine Williams driver needed only to finish ahead of rival Nelson Piquet of Brabham in the final race that year to win the title. He qualified on pole, but he was fourth by the first corner and faded to seventh in the race. Piquet, who had to be helped out of the car at the end of the race he was so exhausted, finished fifth and won the title. Reutemann just fell apart, and that was all in the head. That's the sort of pressure a title showdown can bring to you. The worst thing you can do is let it attack you. The best thing you can do is just breathe. But that is easier to say than do, I can tell you. Hamilton has been very up and down in terms of results since the summer break. He drove a great race in Spa to finish third from the back of the grid, then dominated Monza only to mess up the start and get beaten by Rosberg. In Singapore, he was nowhere by comparison. Then he dominated Malaysia until his engine failure while leading, and in Japan last weekend he was again slightly off Rosberg's pace, and messed up the start. He was unfortunate in being on the wetter side of the track at the start, but that was not the only thing that went wrong, getting some wheelspin as well. Starts have been Mercedes' weak area this year. But for some reason Hamilton has had more difficulty than Rosberg - it's 5-3 in terms of bad starts. If I was Hamilton, I would simply focus hard on getting that sorted out, because he has to make four good starts in the final four races. But then you have make sure you don't make that the real tension point. If he can sort that out, I think he can win the races, and after that he can't change anything more. He can just watch what happens behind him. Japan was a difficult weekend all round for Hamilton. He also got himself embroiled in two controversies with the media, neither of which was necessary, both of which were potentially counter-productive. It is true to say that on the one hand we want the drivers to be using social media to connect to the fans, but that having done that Hamilton has been criticised. But, having said that, the official news conference was not the appropriate time or place to be doing it, and it was a little bit silly to do what he did. The problem was that it became a talking point. That wound him up, created tension and inner angst. And then he made more trouble for himself by refusing to answer questions in his post-qualifying news conference two days later. He had a right to say what he did that day, and was quite polite in the way he did, I'm told. But whether it was the right thing to do is another matter. It simply created another talking point around Hamilton, and it certainly didn't defuse the pressure. It made headlines. That is good for F1. Whether it is good for Lewis Hamilton is a different question. At the same time, his team-mate was able to glide along out of the spotlight. You don't need that sort of distraction as a driver. You need to focus and concentrate on the only thing that matters, which is winning the races, not worrying about whether the media have been disrespectful or whatever. I would think he will be avoiding that in the next few races. At the same time, that is who Lewis Hamilton is, and people love him or hate him for it.

data puts the doctor in your pocket Helping feed the world with big data Bad guys v the data defenders Why? Because these are the questions first date couples agree on most often, he says. Mr Rudder discovered this by analysing large amounts of data on OKCupid members who ended up in relationships. Dating agencies like OKCupid, Match.com - which acquired OKCupid in 2011 for $50m (\u00c2\u00a330m) - eHarmony and many others, amass this data by making users answer questions about themselves when they sign up. Some agencies ask as many as 400 questions, and the answers are fed in to large data repositories. Match.com estimates that it has more than 70 terabytes (70,000 gigabytes) of data about its customers. Applying big data analytics to these treasure troves of information is helping the agencies provide better matches for their customers. And more satisfied customers mean bigger profits. US internet dating revenues top $2bn (\u00c2\u00a31.2bn) annually, according to research company IBISWorld. Just under one in 10 of all American adults have tried it. The market for dating using mobile apps is particularly strong and is predicted to grow from about $1bn in 2011 to $2.3bn by 2016, according to Juniper Research. There is, however, a problem: people lie. To present themselves in what they believe to be a better light, the information customers provide about themselves is not always completely accurate: men are most commonly economical with the truth about age, height and income, while with women it's age, weight and build. Mr Rudder adds that many users also supply other inaccurate information about themselves unintentionally. \"My intuition is that most of what users enter is true, but people do misunderstand themselves,\" he says. For example, a user may honestly believe that they listen mostly to classical music, but analysis of their iTunes listening history or their Spotify playlists might provide a far more accurate picture of their listening habits. Inaccurate data is a problem because it can lead to unsuitable matches, so some dating agencies are exploring ways to supplement user-provided data with that gathered from other sources. With users' permission, dating services could access vast amounts of data from sources including their browser and search histories, film-viewing habits from services such as Netflix and Lovefilm, and purchase histories from online shops like Amazon. But the problem with this approach is that there is a limit to how much data is really useful, Mr Rudder believes. \"We've found that the answers to some questions provide useful information, but if you just collect more data you don't get high returns on it,\" he says. This hasn't stopped Hinge, a Washington DC-based dating company, gathering information about its customers from their Facebook pages. The data is likely to be accurate because other Facebook users police it, Justin McLeod, the company's founder, believes. \"You can't lie about where you were educated because one of your friends is likely to say, 'You never went to that school',\" he points out. It also infers information about people by looking at their friends, Mr McLeod says. \"There is definitely useful information contained in the fact that you are a friend of someone.\" Hinge suggests matches with people known to their Facebook friends. \"If you show a preference for people who work in finance, or you tend to like Bob's friends but not Ann's, we use that when we curate possible matches,\" he explains. The pool of potential matches can be considerable, because Hinge users have an average of 700 Facebook friends, Mr McLeod adds. But it turns out that algorithms can produce good matches without asking users for any data about themselves at all. For example, Dr Kang Zhao, an assistant professor at the University of Iowa and an expert in business analytics and social network analysis, has created a match-making system based on a technique known as collaborative filtering. Dr Zhao's system looks at users' behaviour as they browse a dating site for prospective partners, and at the responses they receive from people they contact. \"If you are a boy we identify people who like the same girls as you - which indicates similar taste - and people who get the same response from these girls as you do - which indicates similar attractiveness,\" he explains. Dr Zhao's algorithm can then suggest potential partners in the same way websites like Amazon or Netflix recommend products or movies, based on the behaviour of other customers who have bought the same products, or enjoyed the same films. Internet dating may be big business, but no-one has yet devised the perfect matching system. It may well be that the secret of true love is simply not susceptible to big data or any other type of analysis. \"Two people may have exactly the same iTunes history,\" OKCupid's Christian Rudder concludes, \"but if one doesn't like the other's clothes or the way they look then there simply won't be any future in that relationship.\"", "text": ["Special", "Report", ":", "The", "Technology",

64-year-old West Brom boss has coached 18 sides in eight different countries, mainly in Europe. So, how is he viewed across the continent? Here we talk to former players and a top pundit to canvas opinion from four of his former haunts - Sweden, Switzerland, Finland and Italy. Overview: Two league titles with Halmstad. Five with Malmo. Full Hodgson factfile Hodgson topped the table five years running during his time with Malmo in the late 1980s, and it was his dedication and enthusiasm which marked him out. \"His commitment in training was unbelievable, taking part and showing what to do in the sessions. If you show commitment, you win the locker room and the team,\" says former Swedish captain Patrik Andersson,who played under him at Malmo. He said some of the club foundations laid by Hodgson helped the Swedish national side, which went on to finish third at the 1994 World Cup. \"His passion about the game was important to get the team together. Getting along with the players was one of his strengths,\" said Andersson, who was capped 96 times. \"He was always encouraging and always in front of the team, which is very important. He took the pressure from the players.\" Andersson, who played for Blackburn in the 1992-93 season, said he could see why England would turn to his former Malmo boss, but he faces a tricky challenge in a Euro 2012 group alongside Sweden, France and Ukraine. \"I'm not surprised because he has been on the international scene since the late 80s and has done well with Fulham and West Brom. He knows the English scene, the pressure and the players and he has developed his leadership over the years,\" said the former defender. \"France, Sweden and England can all beat each other if they have a good day, so for me it's an open group. \"He has a great reputation here, but we have played so many games against each other, there will be no surprises.\" Overview: Guided national side to last 16 of the 1994 World Cup finals and secured their qualification for Euro 96. Hodgson took his first international post in 1992 after impressing in the country's domestic competition with Neuchatel Xamax. \"We didn't qualify for a World Cup for nearly 30 years and he did that in 1994. He put Swiss football on the map and thereon is history,\" said former Swiss defender Ramon Vega. The ex-Tottenham centre-back said his Swiss experience will help Hodgson with England, whose only major tournament victory remains the 1966 World Cup. \"In what way is it different to the Swiss job? What have the FA and the England team achieved since 1966?\" he said. \"He's the only English manager at the moment proven to do something internationally and he's done it in the Premier League and he's a true English gentleman on top of that. \"He's an English manager who had the courage to go abroad, learn the language and culture and come back and prove himself as well.\" Vega, who played 23 times for his country, believes Hodgson can handle the pressure from fans and the media. \"The beauty about this is he's managed Inter Milan, where there are major stars with major egos, and enormous pressure. England has the pressure too but the image of the England national team is not the best. \"I think what is needed now is to go back to basics and Roy Hodgson fits the bill to do that. He will focus on the sports side and that's what's needed.\" Overview: Uefa Cup runner-up in 1997 during first of two spells at Inter Milan. Later had four months in charge at Udinese. Hodgson is remembered in Italy as a competent, if unspectacular, coach. \"He was at Inter at a time when they were free-spending and under-achieving,\" says Italian football expert Gabriele Marcotti. \"He was one of a long line of managers who came in and tried to fix it but wasn't able to, probably because the club itself was dysfunctional. He wasn't great, but he wasn't terrible. \"Some people still talk about his decision to sell Roberto Carlos, who went on to become one of the best left-backs in the world, but it's easy to pick out errors of judgement like that and it may not have been his decision alone.\" At Inter, Hodgson questioned the defensive qualities of Roberto Carlos, who later won the Champions League three times with Real Madrid In his first spell at Inter, the side lost to German club Schalke on penalties in the Uefa Cup final. He returned two years later for a short stint as technical director. \"He was a good man-manager and a safe pair of hands, which is why he came back to Inter for a second time in a crisis situation,\" said Marcotti. \"People liked him, he was a gentleman but he wasn't considered a huge loss to Italian football. \"Personally, my reservations would be about his ability to judge players from a distance. At Fulham, with the exception of Brede Hangeland, they were mainly players he'd inherited. It was almost like they did well despite his signings.\" Overview: Finland failed by just three points to qualify for Euro 2008, which would have been their first appearance at a major tournament. Attention to detail and organisation were hallmarks of his time in charge, said former striker Jonatan Johansson. \"He rejuvenated my career. I was in and out of the team and under him, I mostly started,\" he said. \"We had a very hard group with Portugal and Poland. He came and organised the team and we had a really good campaign under him. It's the closest we have been to qualifying for a tournament. \"He knows football, how to win games and pick up points. We had a limited squad, but he did a fantastic job. \"He's quite thorough, a very hands-on manager. Everybody has to defend as a team, even the strikers. I think we were the team with the fewest goals conceded in the qualifiers. With a team like England, I'm sure he's going to make them very hard to beat.\" Johansson, who was capped 105 times and played for British clubs including Rangers and Charlton, said Hodgson was meticulous in his preparation. \"He was very good at analysing the opposition and knowing how to play against them. That will be a massive strength, particularly now as there is not much time to the Euros,\" said Johansson, who will manage the reserve side at Scottish club Greenock Morton next season. \"There was a lot of video analysis and going through strengths and weaknesses. He's very good at picking the right players in the right positions and making it work. \"He's strong and disciplined. He was very fair to everybody and has a good presence about him - someone you naturally respect. He's pretty calm, composed, intelligent and well spoken but I have seen him shout and get angry. He can be quite fiery. \"When I went on the pitch I knew what he wanted me to do and that always gives players confidence.\"", "text": ["The", "64-year-old", "West", "Brom", "boss", "has", "coached",

rules and procedures on Saturday descended into chaos. \"Dozens of Sanders delegates exploded in anger at what they called an anti-democratic attempt to steal the convention from them,\" he recounts. In the Byzantine world of Nevada presidential caucus politics, Mrs Clinton had won more votes - and state delegates - than Mr Sanders in the first round on 20 February. That was the \"Nevada caucus\" that got all the attention, with candidates holding rallies in Las Vegas and wall-to-wall media coverage. It marked an inflection point in the Democratic presidential race, as Mrs Clinton shook off a crushing defeat in New Hampshire and went on to dominate the southern states that followed, building a lead she will almost certainly carry to the national convention. In Nevada, however, that first day of voting was only the beginning. In an intermediary round of county caucuses, the Sanders campaign turned out greater numbers, which tilted the balance toward his side. At the state convention on Saturday, Mrs Clinton once again had the higher turnout - in part because some Sanders delegates showed up late, provided insufficient information or were not registered as members of the Democratic Party. The Sanders team wanted the rules changed to accommodate their delegates. The Clinton team refused. Then all hell broke loose. During the proceedings, party leaders, including US Senator Barbara Boxer of California, were roundly booed by Sanders faithful. Scuffles broke out. Chairs were thrown on the stage. Police eventually had to clear the Las Vegas casino convention site. Later that night Sanders supporters circulated the contact information for state party chair Roberta Lange, who was subjected to harassing calls and emailed death threats. The party headquarters was chalked with angry condemnations. The irony is that the weekend battle in Las Vegas was over a shift of two bound delegates - at most - out of the 35 total allocated to represent the state at the national convention. Mrs Clinton currently leads Mr Sanders nationally by 282 delegates and only needs 141 more to clinch the nomination with slightly over 1,000 left to be determined, assuming the \"super delegates\" - party functionaries and officeholders - who currently support her stand by their endorsements. For Sanders backers, however, the events in Las Vegas are about more than just a skirmish over a handful of delegates. \"All of this happened because there has been a bit of a misunderstanding between the 'Democratic' Party and ourselves,\" writes progressive blogger John Laruits. \"They've been labouring under the impression that we - you know, the people - are supposed to subserviently accept what the Democratic Party officials have decreed, but - meanwhile - we (having been misled by the word \"democratic\" being in their name) thought that we would get to have a say in choosing our nominee for president.\" They see a nomination process that is tilted toward an entrenched establishment and its monied interests. In some states, like New York, they condemn registration rules rigged against greater voter turnout. In others, like Arizona, their issue is with perceived fraud or mismanagement at polling places. All the while they watch as their candidate racks up win after win - most recently in Indiana and West Virginia - and make little progress toward cutting into Mrs Clinton's lead. Whether these complaints are justified or not - and Mrs Clinton has, in fact, received millions more votes than her rival - it raises the question of whether the party will be able to pull together to face Donald Trump in the autumn or if more acrimony is in store. Mrs Clinton would have to win more than 60% of the remaining pledged delegates to enter the convention without having to rely on her super delegate support to push her over the top. If Mrs Clinton falls short, Sanders supporters would likely up the pressure on those unbound delegates to back their man and decry what they see as party elders putting their finger on the political scale. Given that the super delegates are political veterans more inclined to support a long-time Democrat like Mrs Clinton than the insurgent, until recently independent-registered Sanders, their efforts will likely be futile. But will it be an ordered, organised, well-mannered process? Or will it look more like Las Vegas? Nevada Democratic Party general counsel Bradley Schrager warns in a formal complaint against Sanders supporters filed to the national party on Monday that it could be the latter. \"The tactics and behaviour on display here in Nevada are harbingers of things to come as Democrats gather in Philadelphia in July for our national convention,\" he writes. \"We write to alert you to what we perceive as the Sander campaign's penchant for extra-parliamentary behaviour - indeed, actual violence - in place of democratic conduct in a convention setting, and furthermore what we can only describe as their encouragement of, and complicity in, a very dangerous atmosphere that ended in chaos and physical threats to fellow Democrats.\" So far the Sanders campaign has been walking a fine line between disavowing the unruly actions and acknowledging the anger their supporters feel at the process. \"Our campaign of course believes in non-violent change, and it goes without saying that I condemn any and all forms of violence, including the personal harassment of individuals,\" Mr Sanders wrote in a statement. He said implications that his campaign has a \"penchant for violence\" were \"nonsense\" and went on to accuse the Nevada Democratic Party leadership of using \"its power to prevent a fair and transparent process\". \"The Democratic Party has a choice,\" he said. \"It can open its doors and welcome into the party people who are prepared to fight for real economic and social change - people who are willing to take on Wall Street, corporate greed and a fossil fuel industry which is destroying this planet. Or the party can choose to maintain its status quo structure, remain dependent on big-money campaign contributions and be a party with limited participation and limited energy.\" The Sanders release, which did not directly address the death threats and allegations violence on Saturday, did little to smooth over raw emotions. Nevada Senator Harry Reid, who calls the shots in the state party and leads the Democrats in the US Senate, said the statement was \"silly\". \"Bernie is better than that,\" he told CNN. \"I thought he was going to do something different.\" Meanwhile, presumptive Republican nominee Trump waits in the wings - and is even egging the Vermont senator to bolt his newly adopted party and launch an independent bid for the presidency. \"Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Dems,\" he tweeted on Monday. \"The system is rigged against him. He should run as an independent!\" Such a development would greatly improve the New York real estate mogul's chances at winning the White House, of course. \"Trump obviously would like a third-party candidate on the left so that he could try to divide the vote and win,\" Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said when asked to response to the Trump tweet. \"But I think what you're going to see is unity to defeat Trump.\" There were scant signs of that in Nevada, however.", "text": ["As", "veteran", "Nevada", "political", "writer", "Jon", "Ralston", "reports", ",", "an", "argument", "over",

minister's refusal to take part unless the Green Party was involved a \"pathetic excuse\". He said he would debate with \"anyone invited by the broadcasters\". But Mr Cameron said the Labour leader was \"chickening\" out of facing the Greens and all \"national parties\" must be represented. The exchanges came after Mr Miliband, Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and UKIP leader Nigel Farage urged broadcasters to press ahead with televised debates before the 7 May poll even if Mr Cameron refuses to take part. The three leaders have written to Mr Cameron saying it would be \"unacceptable\" for the prime minister to refuse to appear, saying an empty podium should be provided in his absence. In response, the BBC, Sky News, ITV and Channel 4 said they \"remain committed\" to staging debates before the poll on 7 May. Raising the issue in Parliament, Mr Miliband said Mr Cameron had argued back in 2010 that it would be \"feeble\" for any party leader to walk away from the debates but was now threatening to do just that. A high stakes poker game in which the ultimate prize is power - that is what the row about TV leaders election debate has now become. The players at the table are not just the nation's party leaders but also the bosses of the country's biggest broadcasters. Watching and waiting are highly paid lawyers who know that this may end up being resolve by a judge and not by the court of public opinion. The question is - will anyone blink before it gets to the court-room? Read more from Nick \"It is not for him, it is not for me, it is not for any party leader to decide who is in the debate,\" he said. \"It is up to the broadcasters, that is the country we live in. \"I think he does protest too much. He has run out of excuses, he is running scared of these debates and in the words of his heroine Margaret Thatcher 'he is frit'\". Mr Cameron said Mr Miliband wanted \"to debate having a debate\" because he did not want to talk about the economy and other issues. He said he was keen to defend his record during the campaign, suggesting he would support the idea of two debates, one a head-to-head encounter between him and Mr Miliband and another in which all \"national parties\" were represented. \"The more time he and I can spend on television and in the television studio, the happier I will be,\" he said. But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who was sitting next to the prime minister, was heard shouting \"excuses, excuses\" as Mr Cameron answered one of Mr Miliband's questions. In identical letters to Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband, Mr Clegg and Mr Farage called for a repeat of the 2010 debates - the first ever leaders' TV debates in a British election - and insisted they \"not the property of the politicians\". They wrote: \"I believe it would be a major setback to our democratic processes if these debates were not repeated in 2015 because of one politician's unwillingness to participate.\" The added: \"Therefore, if you are unwilling to reconsider, the three party leaders who have committed to participate will ask the broadcasters to press ahead with the debates and provide an empty podium should you have a last-minute change of heart.\" Under plans put forward by the BBC, Sky News, ITV and Channel 4 in October, the pre-election live TV debates would include the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats and UKIP. Mr Cameron would take on Labour leader Mr Miliband head-to-head in one debate, another would feature Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and Lib Dem leader Mr Clegg, and a third would also include UKIP's Mr Farage. The suggested schedule is for debates on 2 April, 16 April and 30 April, ahead of the general election on 7 May. Mr Farage said the BBC would be \"within its rights\", under the terms of its editorial guidelines, to stage a debate without Mr Cameron and providing an empty podium would be \"entirely appropriate\". \"If David Cameron chooses not to turn up that is his hard luck,\" he told the BBC News Channel. \"My guess is that if the broadcasters hold firm, Mr Cameron will buckle and say yes.\" Lord Ashdown, who is leading the Lib Dems' general election campaign, urged broadcasters to \"stick to their guns\" or else he feared the impetus for the debates would \"ebb away\". He told Sky News: \"You just can't let the prime minister or anybody else basically hold the country and our democracy to ransom by saying no.\" But Green Party leader Natalie Bennett said she backed Mr Cameron's stance and said it was in the interest of the three other leaders to help persuade broadcasters that her party should be included in one of the debates. Ms Bennett said ITV had not yet made a final decision and she hoped to hold talks with the broadcaster in the near future. \"Staging the debates without the prime minister might score a point but would not serve the public, who rightly expect the political parties and the broadcasters to find a format that is acceptable to all concerned,\" she wrote in a letter to the trio. \"If you indicated that you were open to the inclusion of the Greens, then I feel sure that ITV would respond.\" John Curtice, professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde, said that having \"nailed his colours to the mast\" over the Green Party's participation, it would be difficult for Mr Cameron to shun the debates if they were invited. The three debates in 2010 were watched by a total of 22 million people, and they have been cited as one reason for the increase in turnout at the election, which rose for the first time since 1992. While the debates were a \"good test of political leadership\", Prof Curtice told the BBC that they had dominated the campaign and \"not necessarily succeeded in reaching out to more marginal voters\". The SNP and Plaid Cymru, which have more seats in Parliament than either UKIP or the Green Party, also say they should be represented in any series of debates. SNP deputy leader Stuart Hosie said: \"The idea that the SNP, bigger than UKIP and the Lib Dems combined in terms of membership, should be excluded from debates which are broadcast into people's homes in Scotland is just simply quite unacceptable.\" In a statement, the four broadcasters said: \"The debates played an important role in informing millions of our viewers in 2010 and we will continue to work with all the parties to ensure that they happen again in 2015\". The Guardian, Daily Telegraph and YouTube are proposing a separate digital debate, which they suggest could reach up to 55 million internet users.

[0.6103646833013435]}, {"raw_text": "Chief medical officer for England, Prof Dame Sally Davies, has been answering some of your questions about antibiotics. @Nidgster tweets: Why are doctors so keen to give them out - for anything. Dame Sally Davies answers: It is not fair to say that doctors give antibiotics out for anything. Doctors do want to meet their patients' expectations, and many say they often feel pressured into giving out a prescription. There is currently no test that doctors can do in their surgeries to check if a patient is unwell because of an infection caused by bacteria or a virus. This means that a doctor might prescribe the antibiotic as a precaution. However, last week, the public voted for antibiotics to be the subject of the \u00a310m Longitude Prize to develop a rapid diagnostic that will enable doctors worldwide to properly identify those patients for whom antibiotics will actually be effective. This is testament to a growing public appreciation of the problems of antimicrobial resistance. @RPeberdy tweets: How much does it cost to bring a new drug through development, 2testing & to market? Respectfully @longitudeprize? Dame Sally Davies answers: The cost of bringing an individual antimicrobial drug to market is thought to be in the region of \u00a3750m to \u00a31.2bn. @IainFrater tweets: What can be done about poor use of antibiotics outside the UK to combat #antibioticresistance? #bacteriaacrossborders Dame Sally Davies answers: We can use our influence to work with other countries and organisations like the World Health Organization and the European Commission to make sure that all countries have a common understanding of this issue and are doing their bit. We are working with other countries in the Commonwealth to help them improve the systems they have to monitor resistance and respond to outbreaks of infections. Daniel, Southampton, emails: How long do you think this review will take, and then how long before we see action taken? Dame Sally Davies answers: We expect it will take up to two years. The review will present its initial findings in 2015, with the final report and recommendations due in 2016. If there is international consensus on the recommendations, there is no reason why the recommendations shouldn't be actioned as quickly as possible. Charles Glasse, London, emails: How can a firm, like Basilea, be expected to invest typically 1bn euros in developing a new class of antibiotic that will be bought by health services to simply sit on the top shelf only to be used in the currently rare cases of total resistance? A \u00a310m prize is not a serious incentive. Dame Sally Davies answers: Firstly - the \u00a310m prize is being offered for the development of a diagnostic test. It is precisely this problem that has led to the establishment of this new independent review - we need to explore how we can make investment in antibiotics more attractive to pharmaceutical companies. Ensuring there is a balance between providing incentives and conserving the drugs so they stay effective is a key issue that the review will look at. Paul Davey, Haywards Heath, Sussex, emails: Are patent lengths too short? If we want more new antibiotics (as well as using current ones more effectively) do we need to reach a fairer deal for drug companies and society? Why do patents on drugs that take millions of pounds to develop and test and license last 20 years? Dame Sally Davies answers: This is precisely the kind of issue the new review will look at. There are many different things we could do to help stimulate research and development and provide incentives to drug companies - but we need to identify which would be the most effective and would be acceptable to other countries. The UK cannot sort this one out on its own, we need to agree the best approach internationally. Brian Plunkett, Bedfordshire, emails: There seems to be endless supply of products available to the consumer for killing off bacteria in the home - sprays and wipes. Surely this must contribute a little in us, as humans now in danger of simple bacteria causing us harm by resistance - our immune systems being compromised. What should we do? We cannot all live in a bubble, our lives and our environment should perhaps be less sterile. Dame Sally Davies answers: It is bacteria that become resistant, not humans. It is important that we all practise good hygiene, like washing our hands, in our day to day lives. David Thomas, Paisley, Renfrewshire, emails: Why do we allow farmers to use antibiotics as growth promoters? Is this not a major source of resistant bacteria? Dame Sally Davies answers: In the UK we believe that the major driver of resistance is prescribing for humans. Antibiotic growth promoters have been banned in the EU since 2006. Nevertheless we appreciate that good farm management, biosecurity, and animal husbandry systems are vital to minimise the occurrence of disease and therefore reduce the need for antibiotic use. The government has made it clear that the routine use of antibiotics (ie as a prophylactic strategy) in the farming sector is considered wholly inappropriate. The Department of Health works closely with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to make sure the right drug, right dose and right duration is used to limit unnecessary antibiotic exposure. Dev, Buckinghamshire, emails: I am aware there are some amazing sources of very powerful antimicrobial substances already well known and available in nature ie found in wild oregano oil, gut of the crocodile, sea cucumbers, sponges, marigold leaves, mangosteen fruit, turmeric root, neem leaves et cetera. I in fact regularly treat my sinus and skin infections with pure oregano oil, and it works like a charm without any side effects. Why is there so little public awareness of it? And why can't they be commercialised? Dame Sally Davies answers: The use of any new antimicrobial has got to be scientifically based and peer reviewed. There aren't any studies that indicate alternative treatments like these can contribute to the reduction of serious bloodstream infections. Sarah, Birmingham, emails: Why don't hospitals, schools, and other institutions use therapeutic essential oils (TEO) to stop the problem with bacteria and viruses as TEO have been shown to be effective against bacteria and viruses to an equivalent or greater level than antibiotics. Dame Sally Davies answers: Research into new and innovative approaches to the treatment and prevention of infections is very important. There aren't any studies that indicate alternative treatments like these can contribute to the reduction of serious bloodstream infections. There are agencies that cover significant research of this sort, like the Medical Research Council which covers research across the biomedical spectrum, from fundamental lab-based science to clinical trials. The MRC works closely with the NHS and the Department of Health on research that is likely to make a real difference to clinical practice and the health of the population. Zoe Stokes, Loughborough, Leicestershire, emails: Has the CMO sought to liaise with the CVO on this matter? I am a vet student and see antibiotics used 'willy-nilly' on farms all the time more often than not as a preventative treatment rather than where needed. If we are loading our food/milk sources with antibiotics surely this cannot be a positive contribution to the problem? Dame Sally Davies answers: Yes, I am working very closely with the chief veterinary officer on this issue and I am aware that there are a number of initiatives under way that aim to promote the responsible use of antibiotics in the animal sector. The approach we are taking to tackle this problem spans people, animals, agriculture and the wider environment. Rupert Millard, Oldbury, West Midlands, emails: I am a registrar in a GP surgery. I see a lot of people who want antibiotics for self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections. Most understand when I explain that their condition is caused by a virus and will get better on its own, but a significant minority are clearly disappointed (some are rude) and react like I'm holding back appropriate treatment. Could you do something to proactively manage patients' expectations in this regard? Dame Sally Davies answers: We have been working to promote key messages about antibiotics to the public for some time, but we need to do more to engage them and help to change attitudes.

conflict with President Bashar al-Assad. In January 2014, US President Barack Obama downplayed the capabilities and threats posed by those flying the al-Qaeda flag in Falluja and elsewhere across Iraq and Syria. But within a few months, IS controlled a vast and valuable swathe of territory across northern Syria and Iraq. Former US Secretary of Defence Chuck Hagel described IS as being as \"sophisticated and well-funded as any group that we have seen\". \"They're beyond just a terrorist group\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 they are tremendously well funded,\" he said. Islamic State: sale of oil, tolls and 'taxes' $2bn Afghan Taliban: donors, sale of drugs $400m Al-Shabab: sale of charcoal and 'taxes' up to $100m Boko Haram: kidnap for ransom, fundraising $10m Al Nusra Front: donations, kidnap for ransom $ unknown More than with any other militant group perhaps, the focus of the international community's attention is on the finances of IS - the revenue it earns from oil, taxation, extortion and looting. The US-led coalition has directed a considerable portion of its air strike effort against the oil refineries and smuggling routes believed to be the mainstay of the group's financial survival in the belief that disrupting funding sources will ultimately precipitate its demise. The importance of financing in conflict is as old as conflict itself. The Roman orator Marcus Tullius Cicero observed that \"the sinews of war are a limitless supply of money.\" More recently, during the Cold War, states sponsored political violence by funding and supporting proxies. However, the end of the Cold War, and the use of UN Security Council resolutions against countries such as Libya and Sudan, saw a dramatic decline in state-sponsored terrorism. Whilst organisations such as Hezbollah continue to operate with state backing, post-Cold War terrorist organisations have mostly been unable to rely on state sponsorship, thus needing to source their own financing. Skilful financial management is at the heart of the success of any terrorist or insurgent organisation - it represents their lifeblood but is also one of their most significant vulnerabilities. Securing and maintaining reliable funding is the key to moving from fringe radical group to recognised terrorist organisation - from a hand-to-mouth existence to a more planned and organised model. Successful groups are often defined as much by their skills as financial managers as they are by their military expertise and ability to recruit fighters. In general, terrorist groups can draw on financing from two primary sources Donations are also sometimes transferred between like-minded terrorist groups. For example, the Nigerian group Boko Haram reportedly received $250,000 from al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) in 2012. In a letter from 2005, al-Qaeda's former deputy leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, called upon al-Qaeda in Iraq to transfer $100,000 (\u00c2\u00a363,700) because many of its own funding lines had been cut. Whilst donations can provide a source of initial \"seed-funding\", they are vulnerable to disruption by the authorities and the supply is unreliable. To establish financial independence, terrorist groups need to move from primarily external funding to internal, self-generated funding that is more difficult for the international community to disrupt. Al-Shabab in Somalia is a good case in point. Whilst the group receives some limited funding from external sources, it has developed a highly effective charcoal export business which generates up to $80m a year, according to the UN. Al-Shabab has also mastered another funding tool - business, personal and transport tax. Like IS, al-Shabab controls territory and population, operating a form of quasi-government in the areas under its control - raising taxes and offering some services, particularly security and justice, in return. IS promises services and food supplies to Muslims in areas it controls. The control of territory also allows lucrative businesses, such as the growing of opium poppies in Afghanistan, to flourish. Over $7bn has been spent on fighting the drugs trade in the country yet despite 13 years of a Nato-led effort, poppy cultivation is at an all-time high, with the Taliban exploiting Afghanistan's position as the supplier of over 90% of global opium output to earn up to $150m a year. But not all groups control territory containing populations ripe for taxation and extortion. Based in the vast, sparsely inhabited regions across the Sahara and Sahel, AQIM raises its funding from two main sources The Haqqani Network, based in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region, also relies on smuggling as a key source of finance. With its roots in the opposition to the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, it controls long-established smuggling routes that benefit from the instability in Afghanistan and Pakistan to support the funds it raises from its extensive criminal activity. Kidnap for ransom is increasingly used by terrorist groups. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which is based in Yemen, is estimated to have earned $20m this way between 2011 and 2013. The UN underlines the profitability of this trade, revealing recently that terrorist groups are estimated to have earned $120m in ransom payments from 2004-2012. IS alone is believed to have raised up to $45m in just the past year. So if terrorist groups are to establish themselves, survive and thrive, they need to develop reliable sources of financing based on the territory, population and resources where they operate. That Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) recognised the critical importance of finance is clear from declassified documents captured in Iraq following the 2003 invasion in which the group identified poor money management and irregular income as critical contributors to the group's failure. Funding is clearly the lifeblood of a terrorist organisation. It is also its Achilles' heel. Since the 9/11 attacks, the international community has sought to disrupt terrorist groups by targeting their finances. The first step in US President George W Bush's so-called \"war on terror\" was to launch \"a strike on the financial foundation of the global terror network\". Yet, as we are witnessing across northern Syria and Iraq, starving extremists of financing is no easy task once they evolve from external reliance to internal self-sufficiency.", "text": ["Even",

apparent fall from grace has seen her lift the lid on the secretive politics of one of Central Asia's most authoritarian states. Viewed until recently as a potential successor to her father, the publicity savvy Ms Karimova has been using the micro blogging site Twitter to attack key figures and institutions of the Uzbek regime. Her unprecedented actions come in response to moves apparently aimed at curbing her influence. Apart from her artistic ventures, which have included a pop video with French actor Gerard Depardieu, Ms Karimova has built a reputation as a powerful businesswoman. She has been closely associated with several TV and radio channels which routinely portray her as a philanthropist and patron of the arts. Through her Fund Forum organisation Ms Karimova has organised a steady stream of public events, from charity mass weddings to the annual StyleUz art festival. But her pervasive media presence has taken a sudden nosedive. Last month a handful of TV and radio channels close to Ms Karimova stopped broadcasting. One media group was put under investigation on suspicion of financial wrongdoing. The media blackout also hit Ms Karimova's showpiece event - the annual StyleUz festival - usually graced by international stars; both Jose Carreras and Sting have performed in the past. But in contrast to the routine headline coverage of past years, state media gave the 2013 event the cold shoulder. On top of that, the singer Lara Fabian pulled out after being criticised for agreeing to perform in a country known for human rights abuses. The Fund Forum organisation running the event, and which Ms Karimova chairs, has since come under pressure from financial regulators. In response Ms Karimova has lashed out on Twitter, an unprecedented move in the secretive country where the media are tightly controlled. In a tweet from 13 November she claimed that men with assault rifles had ransacked the youth studio of one of the closed TV stations. \"People were beaten up,\" she wrote, adding that young people had been intimidated with fabricated cases of sabotage and anti-government sentiments. But her most astonishing comments came when she accused the country's powerful security chief, Rustam Inoyatov, of masterminding the hostility against her and of aiming for the country's top post. Responding to a tweet asking her if Rustam Inoyatov would seek the presidency, she tweeted: \"He will! He is already fighting for it!\" She also accused Mr Inoyatov of threatening her and stopping her from running for president. \"This is what he said,\" she wrote. \"We will not touch you if you lie low.\" In other tweets Ms Karimova alleged that the security service is using threats, beatings and forced confessions, even against its own officers. \"They have already beaten up staff members to force them to confess to actions they did not commit,\" she wrote on 4 November, giving details of the beating of one officer who she claimed had his ribs broken. She also wrote that officers had been targeted for blowing the whistle on illegal activities in the security apparatus such as drinking at work, racketeering and smuggling alcohol and cigarettes. Such allegations chime with accusations by human rights bodies who say torture and mistreatment are systematic in Uzbekistan's justice system, something regime figures routinely deny. Observers say the public outpourings have brought into the open an intensifying rivalry within the Uzbek elite with the question of who will replace 75-year-old President Karimov looming large. Ms Karimova has long been seen as a leading contender, but a series of problems at home and abroad have undermined her. Last year her name became embroiled with a wide-ranging money-laundering and bribery investigation in Sweden and Switzerland after several of her close associates became suspects. This year the probe came closer to home with reports that her properties in France had been searched as part of the investigations. In September her troubles became personal when her younger sister, Lola Karimova-Tillyaeva revealed in comments to the BBC that the siblings had not spoken for years and the family was deeply divided. Miss Lola Karimova-Tillyaeva also gave short shrift to her sister's chances of becoming president. In an apparent response Ms Karimova accused her sister and mother of engaging in sorcery. More broadly she has blamed the negative headlines on enemies trying to blacken her name. But she is now facing much more serious threats. Ms Karimova has alleged that there were attempts to shut down her Fund Forum organisation and that people were collecting negative facts against her. Given her place in a regime notorious for choking off civil society organisations, her defence of NGOs and free speech seems startling. \"What kind of NGO's can operate in the country then? Maybe only docile and silent ones can?\" she tweeted on 7 November. Ms Karimova also wrote there had been attempts to poison her with mercury and that she was still receiving medical treatment. The pressure has been telling. Ms Karimova has distanced herself from any presidential ambitions, saying she was not interested in \"that hellish post\". More recently she tweeted, \"they want me to shut up already and leave\".

They are angry about a controversial law signed by President Vladimir Putin banning the promotion of \"non-traditional values\" to children, the refusal to allow gay pride events and harassment of gay activists. Many conservative Russians suspect gay rights campaigners of trying to undermine traditional family values. The purpose of the vodka boycott is clear: to harm the image of a product that has become a national brand, symbolising Russia. Some activists suggest going further by boycotting the 2014 Winter Olympics, due to be held in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi. The SPI Group behind the most famous vodka brand in the West - Stolichnaya - has declared its firm support for the LGBT community. Russian Standard - another popular vodka brand in the UK - declined to comment. The vodka boycott campaign was launched by US writer and activist Dan Savage. He wrote in his blog that gay bars in Seattle should \"dump Stoli... to show our solidarity with Russian queers and their allies and to help to draw international attention to the persecution of gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, trans people, and straight allies in Putin's increasingly fascistic Russia\". Savage's initiative generated a swift response in the US and Canada, and then on the other side of the Atlantic. Jeremy Joseph is co-founder and owner of the G-A-Y Group, which owns a bar chain of the same name. He sees the vodka boycott as an act of solidarity with the Russian LGBT community. \"There are other countries where it is illegal to be lesbian or gay. But this is shocking, because they are taking a step back rather than a step forward. And in the last couple of weeks, looking at some of the videos and stories coming out of Russia - it's so horrific, it's so scary,\" Mr Joseph said in an interview with BBC Russian. Moreover, Mr Joseph believes that boycotting Russian vodka may be just the beginning. \"Hopefully, this would lead to not just Russian vodka being banned, but looking at the brands that will be sponsoring the Winter Olympics who will know that unless they make a stand, then their products will get banned.\" At the same time, the G-A-Y Group owner does not believe that a high-profile campaign in the West will make life worse for LGBT people in Russia. \"How can it get any worse? I would like to hope, not. But what do we do? Sit back and do nothing?\" he asks. Peter Tatchell, a veteran gay rights activist and human rights campaigner, has expressed his support for the vodka boycott. \"The Russian government has passed a draconian new homophobic law that criminalises any public expression of gay identity or call for gay human rights,\" Mr Tatchell told BBC Russian. \"In addition, there has been a wave of organised homophobic violence targeting individual LGBT people. Some of the victims have been tortured or killed. The police are doing little or nothing to bring the perpetrators to justice,\" he adds. \"Russian LGBT organisations and international human rights groups have appealed to the Russian government to scrap the anti-gay laws and crack down on homophobic violence. Their appeals have been ignored, the repression is intensifying\", says Mr Tatchell. Mr Tatchell describes calls to boycott Russian products as an act of despair and expresses hope that \"this campaign will go global in the coming weeks\". Val Mendeleev, chief executive officer of the SPI Group, which owns Stolichnaya, said his company \"is an apolitical, business-oriented organisation\". \"However, the LGBT community in the US and worldwide are consumers of Stoli Premium vodka globally, and as such are our stakeholders,\" he told BBC Russian. Mr Mendeleev stresses that his company's \"corporate values stand for transparency, fairness, equality and diversity\". Earlier he wrote an open letter to the LGBT community, which was published on the SPI Group's website and on Facebook page. \"Stolichnaya Vodka has always been, and continues to be a fervent supporter and friend to the LGBT community,\" he wrote, citing examples of the SPI Group's support for gay events all over the world, including gay pride events in Durban, Tel Aviv and Vienna. He also said Stolichnaya should not be regarded as a Russian product, since it is produced in Latvia, albeit using Russian ingredients. Chris Amos, the owner and manager of Manbar in London's Soho, welcomed Mr Mendeleev's statement. \"It's regrettable for them that they are getting the raft of the gay fury and all of this. But at the same time, it will be them and other Russian companies like them who will then go back to the Russian government to argue for our case and support our case,\" he told BBC Russian. \"That's great that they are doing that writing the letter, but that doesn't stop the boycott. And the boycott will hopefully go to other Russian companies, who will - like Stoli - issue statements in support of the gay and lesbian population\", Mr Amos said. LGBT activists have been discussing another form of protest against the Russian authorities: boycotting the 2014 Sochi Olympics. Jeremy Joseph of the G-A-Y Group is fully behind the idea. \"I personally believe that Russia doesn't have the right to host the Winter Olympics now\", he argues. \"There is supposed to be an Olympic spirit of everybody joining together as one. How can you have it in a country that is so prejudiced?\" Dan Savage, however, believes that it would be better if athletes from the LGBT community went to Sochi to compete and win, to show the whole world they are not afraid to be themselves. Last Friday, the International Olympic Committee announced that it had received assurances from the Russian officials that \"the new anti-gay legislation will not affect those attending or taking part in the games\". But immediately after that one of the most prominent Russian anti-gay campaigners, Vitaly Milonov of St Petersburg Legislative Assembly, called on the Russian authorities to refrain from applying the gay-propaganda law inconsistently during the Sochi Olympics. After all, Mr Milonov actively participated in writing it.", "text": ["The", "organisers", "accuse", "the", "Russian", "authorities", "of", "an", "increasingly", "aggressive", "stance", "towards",

France, Greece and Spain a hangover from the crash of 2007-8, the euro crisis of 2010-13 and long years of squeezed living standards - a protest from those who feel dispossessed in an economic sense? Or does the surge of UKIP, the Front National and Syriza, inter alia, reflect a more profound sense that the mainstream parties and conventional political institutions no longer serve the interests of millions of people? Is it \"the economy, stupid\", or is it \"globalisation and a dysfunctional EU, stupid\"? The answer matters. Maybe the economy is easier to fix - although not necessarily in the eurozone, which still lacks the requisite cross-border political solidarity that would allow the excessive debt burden to be pooled, and its growth-deadening impact to be mitigated. As for the UK, it is possible that the current economic recovery will suddenly translate into a significant rise in living standards, that has been so elusive for six years. But the prime minister might not be best advised to count on it. A significant microcosm of both the problem and the solution is London - where, significantly, UKIP resonated less and performed less well than elsewhere. Part of the explanation is that globalisation - which gives many a sense that they have little direct control over their economic destiny - enriches London. Much of the rest of the UK sees globalisation and its manifestations - such as immigration - as disempowering, impoverishing and a threat. Whereas for Londoners, globalisation is an economic competition they are apparently winning. Of course, there are tensions within London generated by the nature of its success - the west London ghettoes of the non-dom super-rich aren't everyone's cup of tea, and high and inflationary property prices undermine social cohesion. But I haven't heard many Londoners describe the capital as \"the dark star of the economy\", which is how it was characterised in March by the First Minister of Scotland, Alex Salmond. The capital's gravitational pull for what Mr Salmond called \"resources, people and energy\" is bound to be seen with different degrees of enthusiasm by those inside and outside the Great Wen. Alex Salmond's hope was that an independent Scotland would be able to exert a new pull for talent and money, and provide more economic balance in this island. Which some would say is a challenging argument to make, since the trends that are pumping up London are supra-national. In a world where barriers to the flow of money, services, people, goods and data have progressively been removed, vast flows of money, services, people, goods and data are drawn to where they find their ilk. Or to put it another way, the rise of London is the rise of one of the world's megacities, those urban centres which thrive semi-independently of the countries where they are located. According to the consultancy McKinsey, some 70% of all worldwide economic activity takes place in the world's 600 largest cities. And the most vital cities, on its analysis, are those that are most connected by becoming hubs or waypoints for skilled people, for goods, for services, for capital, and for data. On this view, London is one of only six truly connected cities, along with New York, Dubai, Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo. London scores relatively poorly only for goods traffic. What is striking about this half-dozen of the global elite metropolises is that three of them, Dubai, Hong Kong and Singapore, are city-states. So it is not surprising that London is seen by some, including seemingly Mayor Johnson periodically, as extra the UK, almost a city-state. Inevitably therefore one of the big political and economic questions of our age is whether national governments should encourage or attempt to stifle the rise and rise of these great cities - because they can be seen not only as economically over-mighty but politically too. The British government sees London as a great asset to be nurtured - punching above its weight in respect of tax generation and helping to sell the UK to the rest of the world. So it will probably see the latest forecast by the CEBR of London's growth as a reason to be cheerful. The CEBR sees London as accounting for almost a third of all UK growth in the next five years. The CEBR expects the London economy to expand by 15.4% till 2019, faster than other UK regions, and compared with 10.7% for the UK as a whole. Which means that London's share of the total British economy will continue to grow. According to official figures, the output or gross value added of London was 21% of UK output in 2007. It had risen to 22% in 2011, and if the CEBR is right, London will be nudging a quarter of the entire UK economy by 2019. Looked at in that way, it is pretty difficult to see how London could be put back in its box, even if the government wished to do this, without doing serious harm to the nation's finances and prosperity. If London's growth were to slow considerably, then revenue generation for the government and employment creation for the country would also slow - probably harmfully. So for those who want a more regionally balanced UK economy, the trick presumably is to spur faster growth outside London. But that has been the ambition of so many governments, for so long. And has arguably become even harder in a world where capital seems increasingly drawn to capitals (very bad pun, sorry). Or to put it another way, the problem isn't London. The problem (if there is one) is that globalisation is all about how money, data and skilled people do what they want and go where they want. Which implies the task of government is to harness and tame capital's love of metropolises in such a way that London and its peers are seen as engines of national wealth creation, and providers of national resources that otherwise would not be affordable. That said, if globalisation means that the rise of London and other outward looking megacities is unstoppable, it is difficult to see how the economic gap between capital and provinces can do anything but continue to widen. And whether redistribution of wealth from urban centre to the rest of the country will allay the legitimate fears of many outside the megacities that the global economy is not run for them, well that is moot.", "text": ["Is", "the", "new", "popularity", "of", "anti-EU", "parties", "in", "the", "UK", ",", "France", ",", "Greece", "and", "Spain", "a", "hangover", "from", "the", "crash", "of",

In addition, they feature new gaming tech and a rear camera that should cope better in low-light conditions. Their overall design, however, is similar to the Galaxy S6 line-up. Some experts suggested that could pose a challenge. \"Although there are significant improvements under the bonnet with the camera, the chipset, the removable storage and the water resistance, Samsung will have to make sure that's visible to consumers,\" commented Ian Fogg from the IHS Technology consultancy. \"Because at a glance they look to be the same as last year's model.\" Samsung does not disclose smartphone sales numbers. However its share of the market dropped by 2% in 2015, according to research firm IDC, at a time when Apple, Huawei and Xiaomi made gains. Even so, IDC's data still indicates the South Korean firm remains the bestselling brand by a wide margin. 1. Samsung Galaxy 2. Samsung Galaxy S 3. Samsung Galaxy S2 4. Samsung Galaxy S3 5. Samsung Galaxy S4 6. Samsung Galaxy S5 7. Samsung Galaxy S6 Samsung's first Android-powered phone ran version 1.5 (Cupcake) of Google's mobile operating system. It had a 3.2in (8.1cm) screen and was the first Android phone to include a 3.5mm headphone jack, allowing normal headphones to be easily connected. The first of Samsung's S-branded series had a 4in (10.2cm) screen, ran Android 2.1 (Eclair) and could shoot video in 720p high definition. A 4G variant of the device attracted the ire of Apple's lawyers, and became part of a high-profile patent case fought by the two rivals. The S2 was marketed as the world's thinnest smartphone, measuring less than 8.5mm (0.33in) thick. It had a 4.3in (10.9cm) screen and was powered by Android 2.3 (Gingerbread). Samsung promoted the \"zero lag\" shutter speed of its main camera as being suitable for snapping fast-moving objects. The S3 used eye-tracking software to detect when it was being looked at, keeping its screen bright until its owner turned away. It had a 4.8in (12.cm) screen and ran Android 4.0.4 (Ice Cream Sandwich). The phone also introduced S-Beam, a way to send files and contacts between Samsung handsets. The S4 bordered on \"phablet\" status with a 5in (12.7cm) touchscreen, which could be used while wearing gloves. Running Android 4.2.2 (Jelly Bean) it introduced a dual-video capture mode, allowing users to record footage from both cameras simultaneously. The S5 added dust and water resistance, promising to work after being submerged 3ft (0.9m) deep. It came pre-installed with Android 4.4.2 (KitKat) and introduced a fingerprint scanner and heart rate monitor. Samsung promoted its \"ultra power saving mode\", which let the device eke out a day of life when its battery fell below 10%. Samsung launched two models of its flagship phone \u2013 the Edge version had a screen that curved round its sides and was more expensive. The phones had brighter, more detailed screens than before, and supported the firm's new smart wallet service Samsung Pay. However, their metal frames and glass-backed designs led to some of the S5's features being jettisoned, including water resistance and the microSD slot. The new handsets were unveiled in Barcelona on the eve of the Mobile World Congress tech show. They are set to be released on 11 March. More from MWC: Rory Cellan-Jones' analysis of the S7 launch LG phone has bolt-on modules Sony puts AI assistant in user's ear Salt water charger powers up phones While the Galaxy S7 retains the same sized screen as the S6, the S7 Edge's display has grown slightly from 5.1in (13cm) to 5.5in (14cm). The Edge version is also slightly curvier than before and its camera protrudes less far out. In addition, the \"edged\" parts of the screen now provide shortcuts to email, different photo modes and third-party apps. Both phones: They also feature processors that are faster than before and capable of supporting the Vulkan API (application program interface). This is an open standard that lets games make more efficient use of a chip's graphics processing units (GPUs). Modern PCs and games consoles can already support Vulkan, but Samsung says its smartphones are the first to do so. The firm has also added a \"thermal spreader\" to the phone's innards. This is a 0.4mm-thick tube of water that turns to steam, cooling down the processor, when required. It should allow the handset to better handle graphics-intensive titles without overheating. In addition, Samsung has made it easier to record gameplay for later playback. The new rear camera introduces two innovations. Firstly, it has a bigger aperture of f/1.7 rather than f/1.9. This means the lens lets in about 25% more light than before. The pixels are also slightly bigger, which should mean the phones are more capable at taking low-light photos without the need for flash. Secondly, its sensor is the first on a smartphone to feature \"dual pixel autofocus\". This means each pixel can be used to both record the image and determine focus rather than just one or the other. This enables the phone to lock focus to an object more quickly for stills, and deliver smoother focus tracking in video mode. The technology was first developed by Canon, and until now was limited to the Japanese firm's DSLR (digital single-lens reflex) and Cinema cameras. \"It's not easy to explain or even show off at the point of sale, and that's something Samsung will struggle with,\" commented IDC analyst Francisco Jeronimo. \"But I believe those users who start using it will quickly realise it does make a difference and will help them get better pictures.\" One consequence of adding the new technologies is that the camera's resolution has had to decrease from 16 megapixels to 12MP. The South Korean firm also introduced a 360-degree camera. It can film footage for playback on its virtual reality headset, which Samsung makes in partnership with Facebook's Oculus division. The Gear 360's interactive pictures and videos can also be uploaded to Facebook and YouTube. The device is only compatible with the firm's own handsets. That contrasts with a similar camera unveiled by LG that works with both Android and iOS phones. One analyst suggested such kit could \"add a new dimension\" to weddings and other big occasions. \"These cameras will allow users to easily create their own 360-degree content, and this will help fuel demand for virtual reality accessories and broader acceptance of the new types of photos and videos,\" said Ben Wood from CCS Insight. It was also revealed that the Samsung Pay smart wallet service would be expanded to the UK, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Singapore and Spain this year. One company watcher suggested it was a \"no brainer\" to pick the new phones over the Galaxy S5 and earlier handsets, but a harder sell when compared to the S6 range. \"Samsung has a problem that is actually shared by most smartphone companies today,\" said Carolina Milanesi from Kantar Worldpanel ComTech. \"Each year's phones look more and more alike and what gets tweaked is more of a finesse to what's inside, and that's really hard to convince customers to pay extra for in stores.\" Even so, a spokesman for Samsung said it intended to leave the S6 phones on sale alongside the new devices.

a dramatic late match-winning score from the visitors' Elliot Daly - France out-muscled a spirited Scotland in Paris on Sunday. Saturday's first fixture - Ireland's 63-10 steam-rollering of Italy - was the sort of confidence-booster that Joe Schmidt's side needed after an opening-weekend defeat by Scotland, but far sterner tests will follow. With a fortnight's break before the next round, there is plenty to ponder. And it is still all up for grabs. England's win over Wales was a very tight game of fine margins, and it was the visitors' perfect execution of the chance they were given to win the match that proved to be the difference. When Jonathan Davies kicked into the backfield in the last four minutes at the Principality Stadium, England were able to impose themselves enough to create an opportunity and were then clear-headed enough to take it. This is a very powerful, confident, internally competitive 23-man England squad. Individually Joe Launchbury and Courtney Lawes were mammoth in the second row, expending huge amounts of energy. Nathan Hughes racked up some huge numbers, with the most metres gained (75), carries (22) and defenders beaten (three) of any England player. Elliot Daly showed himself to be a complete footballer. He showed the gas of a winger to round Alex Cuthbert for the crucial score, but he also has the vision of a very good full-back, the touch of a very good fly-half and added to which he can also kick penalties from his own half. It is powerful thing to be part of a team that has got that winning habit. You are familiar with your team-mates, but training becomes very high level. There is no sympathy for mistakes that slow up the progress of the project and you go onto the field believing that you will find a way to win. England are going to lose at some point and head coach Eddie Jones is right to say there are only so many times that they are going to come through these tight scrapes - but for the moment that confidence the players have is getting them over the line. Jones may decide to use the Italy game to try some new starting combinations to see if the replacements can be as influential from the beginning of matches. Dylan Hartley was off the pace to my eye , but in modern rugby so much will depend on the condition of the players. Compared with the game at Twickenham last year, where Wales made a host of errors and gave England a 16-point lead at half-time, this was a markedly better performance. Wales could have easily won this year's match and when they play with that amount of energy they are a real threat to the top four in world rugby. Some people questioned coach Rob Howley's decision to withdraw number eight Ross Moriarty after 52 minutes. The Gloucester man had had a blast up until then, a real physical presence with some immense hits in defence. But it may have been that that impact was a result of him emptying the tanks in the time he was on the pitch, knowing he was going to be taken off soon after half-time. It is not a given that had he stayed on he would have been able to maintain that pace. The balance of the Wales back row was good with Moriarty everywhere, blind-side flanker Sam Warburton doing the heavy-duty carrying and tackling and open-side Justin Tipuric fetching, disrupting and supporting in space. They were more mobile than their England counterparts and were a big part of Wales securing seven turnovers to England's three. There were a few mistakes and a few opportunities that went begging, but England's pressure and instinctive quality in those split-seconds perhaps forced that. The influence of an opposition as good as England cannot be discounted. Considering they were outgunned in terms of bulk by an enormous France side, the challenge for Scotland was to manoeuvre their opponents around the pitch enough that they tired them out. With eight pairs of fresh legs on the bench at French coach Guy Noves' disposal, that was always going to be difficult. Scotland were capable of doing so, the problem was they could not muster the intensity for long enough periods. It was not physical intensity they lacked. Instead, they had to be dynamic and inventive, and constantly remould their attacking shape to keep France guessing. France knew that was going to be Vern Cotter's gameplan and the hosts were motivated enough to deny them space and momentum. Stuart Hogg and Tim Swinson's tries were well worked, but there were not enough moments where they got around the outside or in behind France. At times it seemed like Scotland had only 14 players on the field. Apart from their two tries, they rarely wobbled this French side. France are brittle mentally in pressure situations, but Scotland did not cause them enough anxiety to see if they would crack again. Scotland could have won the game - but they will not take much solace from that. That has been the story for too many seasons in recent times and they are supposed to have moved on from that. The losing bonus point was something to take from a very tricky away trip though, especially considering how tight the standings are. CJ Stander became the first Irishman to score a Six Nations hat-trick in 15 years, but the way he exploited the space and Italy's weak tackling did not reveal anything new. We already knew from his performances in the autumn that he is a very impressive player who will batter his way through a brick wall with ball in hand. For me, he is untouchable as the best number six in world rugby. Ireland's intensity dropped for a 22-minute spell early in the second half between Stander scoring their fifth try and replacement Craig Gilroy crossing for their sixth, but Joe Schmidt's side kicked back with a strong finish. You have to put this performance in perspective, though. It was against a side who have spluttered badly over the past three halves of rugby that they have played. Coach Conor O'Shea and his assistants Mike Catt and Brendan Venter - who were all together at London Irish in the mid 2000s - are trying to change Italy's culture alongside their style of play. That is a major upheaval and, at the moment, they looked just off the pace. This is my second-round selection of a Lions XV based on the form shown over the weekend.

and Carl Bosch, devised a way to transform nitrogen in the air into fertiliser, using what became known as the Haber-Bosch process. But Haber's place in history is controversial. He is also considered the \"father of chemical warfare\" for his years of work developing and weaponising chlorine and other poisonous gases during World War One. Plants need nitrogen: it is one of their five basic requirements, along with potassium, phosphorus, water and sunlight. In a natural state, plants grow, they die, the nitrogen they contain returns to the soil, and new plants use it to grow. Agriculture disrupts that cycle: we harvest the plants, and eat them. From the earliest days of agriculture, farmers discovered various ways to prevent crop yields from declining over time: by restoring nitrogen to their fields. Manure has nitrogen. So does compost. The roots of legumes host bacteria that replenish nitrogen levels. That is why it helps to include peas or beans in crop rotation. But these techniques struggle to fully satisfy a plant's appetite for nitrogen. Add more, and the plant grows better. That is exactly what Fritz Haber worked out how to do, driven in part by the promise of a lucrative contract from the chemical company BASF. That company's engineer, Carl Bosch, then managed to replicate Haber's process on an industrial scale. Both men later won Nobel Prizes - controversially, in Haber's case, as many by then considered him a war criminal. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world we live in. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast. The Haber-Bosch process is perhaps the most significant example of what economists call \"technological substitution\", where we seem to have reached some basic physical limit, then find a workaround. For most of human history, if you wanted more food to support more people, then you needed more land. But the thing about land, as Mark Twain once joked, is that they are not making it any more. Haber and Bosch provided a substitute: instead of more land, make nitrogen fertiliser. It was like alchemy. \"Brot aus Luft\", as Germans put it, or \"Bread from air\". From air and quite a lot of fossil fuels. First of all, you need natural gas as a source of hydrogen, the element to which nitrogen binds to form ammonia. Then you need energy to generate extreme heat and pressure. Haber discovered that was necessary as a catalyst to break the bonds between air's nitrogen atoms and persuade them to bond with hydrogen instead. Imagine the heat of a wood-fired pizza oven, with the pressure you would experience 2km under the sea. To create those conditions on a scale sufficient to produce 160 million tonnes of ammonia a year - the majority of which is used for fertiliser - the Haber-Bosch process today consumes more than 1% of all the world's energy. That is a lot of carbon emissions. And there is another very serious ecological concern. Only some of the nitrogen in fertiliser makes its way via crops into human stomachs, perhaps as little as 15%. Most of it ends up in the air or water. This is a problem for several reasons. Compounds like nitrous oxide are powerful greenhouse gases. They pollute drinking water. They also create acid rain, which makes soils more acidic, disrupting ecosystems, and threatening biodiversity. When nitrogen compounds run off into rivers, they likewise promote the growth of some organisms more than others. The results include ocean \"dead zones\", where blooms of algae near the surface block out sunlight and kill the fish below. The Haber-Bosch process is not the only cause of these problems, but it is a major one, and it is not going away. Demand for fertiliser is projected to double in the coming century. In truth, scientists still do not fully understand the long-term impact on the environment of converting so much stable, inert nitrogen from the air into various other, highly reactive chemical compounds. We are in the middle of a global experiment. One result is already clear: plenty of food for lots more people. If you look at a graph of global population, you will see it shoot upwards just as Haber-Bosch fertilisers start being widely applied. Again, Haber-Bosch was not the only reason for the spike in food yields. New varieties of crops like wheat and rice also played their part. Still, if we farmed with the best techniques available in Fritz Haber's time, the earth would support about four billion people. Our current population is around seven and a half billion, and growing. Back in 1909, as Haber triumphantly demonstrated his ammonia process, he could hardly have imagined how transformative his work would be. On one side of the ledger, food to feed billions more human souls; on the other, a sustainability crisis that will need more genius to solve. For Haber himself, the consequences of his work were not what he expected. As a young man, he converted from Judaism to Christianity, aching to be accepted as a German patriot. Beyond his work on weaponising chlorine, the Haber-Bosch process also helped Germany in World War One. Ammonia can make explosives, as well as fertiliser. Not just bread from air, but bombs too. When the Nazis took power in the 1930s, however, none of this outweighed his Jewish roots. Stripped of his job and kicked out of the country, Haber died, in a Swiss hotel, a broken man.

Disorder spread to Enfield, Walthamstow and Waltham Forest in north London and to Brixton in the south of the city. Home Secretary Teresa May has cut short her holiday to return to the UK following the disorder. Some 35 officers have been injured over the two nights of rioting. Three officers were hurt when a vehicle hit them as they tried to make an arrest in Waltham Forest, east London. Clashes broke out in Enfield, north London, on Sunday evening where shop windows were smashed and a police car damaged. There have been reports of a gang of up to 200 youths looting shops and charging police in Coldharbour Lane and the High Street in Brixton, south London. Metropolitan Police Commander Adrian Hanstock said: \"This is not groups of people acting on behalf of communities or with any consent. \"This is individuals who are actually attacking communities, businesses, properties and houses and actually causing a huge amount of upset and criminality.\" The Met said it had dealt with several incidents of \"copycat criminal activity\" across the city. These included: Kit Malthouse, Deputy Mayor of London and Chair of the Metropolitan Police Authority, described the scenes of the last two nights as \"disgusting and shocking\" and said the police did a good job. He added: \"Obviously there are people in this city, sadly, who are intent on violence, who are looking for the opportunity to steal and set fire to buildings and create a sense of mayhem, whether they're anarchists or part of organised gangs or just feral youth frankly, who fancy a new pair of trainers.\" Talking about the impact on the capital's image, one year ahead of the Olympic Games, he said: \"It's pretty rotten for London, it does not look good. \"What we need to do over the next few months is to underline to people the fundamental truth about London which is that it is one of the safest, great big cities on earth. \"We have a low murder rate and this kind of violence is very rare.\" The Home Secretary, Theresa May said: \"Last night, police officers again put themselves in harm's way to protect Londoners and their property. \"Londoners have made clear that there are no excuses for violence, and I call on all members of local communities to work constructively with the police to help them bring these criminals to justice.\" BBC London's Paraic O'Brien said he had witnessed widespread looting in Brixton. He said: \"They smashed a William Hill, they set bins on fire. \"And now what we're seeing as the night progresses is that replicated, sort of flashpoints all along Brixton High Street. By Andy MooreBBC News I saw the rioting in Tottenham on Saturday and I saw the rioting last night and it was certainly different in character. What might have been started in Tottenham by youngsters aggrieved about what they saw as police persecution has become something very different in nature. Last night there was a sense that the looting, and violence and disorder across London was being co-ordinated on social media. There were people in their cars, youngsters on bicycles, moving very rapidly, leaving a trail of destruction behind them. As soon as you moved to one location they would move on to the next one. The police were doing their best to catch up with them. You had police vehicles going backwards and forwards, blue lights flashing, riot police coming out of their vehicles. Ten minutes later they'd get back in again and go off to the next location - essentially trying to fight the fires, metaphorically, that were spreading all over London. \"I'm standing outside Halfords on the other side of the road and they've just smashed through the doors of Halfords. They're taking bikes out the front entrance. \"I have to say, what really struck me was the small number of police officers that there actually seem to be on Brixton High Street responding to this.\" Press Association photographer Lewis Whyld saw looters battle police at a Currys store in Brixton. He said: \"A couple of hundred youths were rioting and looting. Riot police went in to get them out and there was a big fight in the street. \"Youths were throwing rocks and bottles and there was a bin on fire. They used a fire extinguisher to push the police back so they could get back into Currys and continue taking things out.\" Met Police Commander Christine Jones said: \"Officers are shocked at the outrageous level of violence directed against them. \"At least nine officers were injured overnight in addition to the 26 injured on Saturday night.\" London Fire Brigade said it had been called to a number of fires in Enfield, Brixton and Walthamstow, including a fire at a shop on Brixton Road, which is now under control. The disorder follows rioting in Tottenham which broke out on Saturday night and continued into Sunday morning. A peaceful protest over the fatal shooting by police on Thursday of 29-year-old Mark Duggan descended into violence later in the evening. The unrest spread into nearby Wood Green and Tottenham Hale. Shops were attacked and looted, 26 police officers and three others were injured and buildings and vehicles were set alight. Tottenham Hotspur Football Club's ticket office was also damaged during the violence. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Kavanagh told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that there were too few officers in Tottenham on Saturday night, but blamed Twitter for fuelling looting and violence, saying: \"Social media and other methods have been used to organise these levels of greed and criminality.\" Mr Kavanagh pledged that more officers would be on London's streets on Monday night to prevent or tackle further outbreaks. Parts of Tottenham are still cordoned off, as officers and forensic specialists continue to examine the riot scene. A total of 61 arrests have been made in connection with the first night of rioting. The majority were for burglary, and other offences including violent disorder, robbery, theft and handling stolen goods. Sixteen people have been charged for offences including burglary, violent disorder and possession of a pointed or bladed weapon following the Tottenham riots. As well as Mr Duggan, a police officer was also shot in Thursday's incident, which happened in what was called a \"pre-planned\" event, under Operation Trident, which investigates gun crime in London's African and Caribbean communities. Police had stopped a minicab which Mr Duggan had been travelling in. The violence has also affected public transport and the roads.

his sporting CV. A hole that can only be filled by five big rings. \"Going back in time the best sportsmen ever have been Olympians,\" said the 30-year-old as he announced he would dedicate himself to being part of rugby sevens' debut at Rio 2016. \"Usain Bolt, Muhammad Ali, the list goes on. It's just an amazing opportunity to become one of those.\" This weekend is the start of that journey as Williams - a little more than a month after lifting the Webb Ellis Cup - heads to Dubai for the first event of the globe-trotting Sevens World Series. This is not one of six World Series events that Williams aims to play in. Instead he has cut short his off-season to meet his new team-mates and learn the seven-a-side game from the sidelines. And he is not the only 15-a-side star aiming to be part of rugby's new frontier. On his flight to the Middle East from Sydney, Williams bumped into Australia fly-half Quade Cooper, the pair tweeting pictures of themselves grinning away in business class. Cooper was en route back to French club Toulon rather than stopping off in Dubai for the sevens. But he is determined to be on the plane to Rio. His contract negotiations with Toulon's hard-ball president Mourad Boudjellal were long and laborious as Cooper successfully fought for the chance to play sevens for Australia alongside his club commitments. When he lands in the south of France, Cooper might discuss his summer plans with new club team-mate Bryan Habana. The Springboks leading try scorer, along with fellow World Cup stars Damian de Allende and Lwazi Mvovo, was invited to train with the South Africa sevens team in November as coach Neil Powell considers whether to import 15-a-side specialists into his Olympic side. Cooper's international team-mates Bernard Foley and Israel Folau have opted for short stints in Japanese club rugby and will make a decision on whether to try their hand at sevens when they return early in 2016. Winger Henry Speight, also part of the Wallabies squad at the World Cup, has already made the switch and is in the Australia squad for the Dubai event. Flanker Liam Messam - another of the All Blacks World Cup-winning squad - has joined Williams in focusing solely on sevens this season. And Argentina winger Santiago Cordero - one of the stars of the Pumas' run to the World Cup semi-finals - is likely to be part of their Rio effort after signing a central contract with his country. Montpellier flanker Fulgence Ouedraogo and Castres winger Remy Grosso helped France secure their place at Rio in the summer before joining their country's Rugby World Cup squad. All those format flip-floppers will have to contend with sevens specialists, men who understand the game's cagey, contact-averse tactics and lactic-heavy physical demands. Wales wing George North has mused on the possibility of joining cyclist girlfriend Becky James in a British Olympic team. Danny Cipriani is interested in being involved after his maverick talents were deemed surplus to England's World Cup requirements. Full-back Stuart Hogg's electric running and courageous tackling for Scotland would surely transfer well to the seven-a-side game. The names come easily. The reality is more complicated. Great Britain qualified for Rio 2016 on the back of England's top-four finish in last season's Sevens World Series and the team will be made up of the best players from England, Scotland and Wales at Rio. However, the chances of recruiting 15-a-side superstars to concentrate on sevens - as Williams has done - is a non-starter for Team GB as they don't have central contracts, while clubs are understandably keen their employees focus on their well-paid day jobs. English club Wasps have indicated that they - and the rest of the Premiership - will adhere to the regulations and only release players two weeks before the tournament. Barring an unforeseen bout of Olympic enthusiasm from clubs in the midst of trying domestic and European campaigns, Great Britain coach Simon Amor is likely to have to wait until the second-tier European Grand Prix Sevens series at least before he can welcome 15-a-side players into the fold. The final leg of that series will take place in Exeter on 9-10 July and Great Britain are hoping their involvement will be confirmed before the end of this year. Amor will then be faced with the unenviable task of condensing players from three different nations and two different formats into one team in less than a month. What Amor would give for the access that Simon Middleton, coach of Great Britain's women's team, has to 15-a-side specialists. A week after England won the Women's Rugby World Cup in August 2014, the Rugby Football Union - mindful of the funding that potential Olympic medals bring to women's rugby - handed 12 of that squad and another eight players contracts to concentrate on sevens full-time. Emily Scarratt, who scored 16 points in that 21-9 World Cup final win over Canada, is captaining England in Dubai, with another five of that historic squad also involved. A Great Britain select seven - including Scots Steph Johnston and Megan Gaffney - also played in an invitational tournament running alongside the main Women's Sevens Series event. Whoever is picked for Rio though, New Zealand will be overwhelming favourites for gold. They have won all three of the Women's World Series titles since the it was introduced in 2012. This season, they have a new recruit with Niall Williams, sister of Sonny Bill, making her debut in Dubai.", "text": ["But", "there", "is", "still", "a", "hole", "in", "his", "sporting", "CV", ".",

{"raw_text": "Godfrey Bloom was recorded saying payments were being used to buy items like sunglasses and luxury cars. He also claimed UK aid was spent on fighter planes in Pakistan. UKIP chairman Steve Crowther said Bongo Bongo Land was an \"outdated description of foreign parts\". In footage obtained by the Guardian, recorded last month at a meeting in Wordsley, West Midlands, Mr Bloom said: \"How we can possibly be giving \u00a31bn a month, when we're in this sort of debt, to Bongo Bongo Land is completely beyond me. By Louise StewartPolitical correspondent, BBC News Godfrey Bloom is no stranger to controversy and he's not shying away from the comments he made. In fact he took to the airwaves to defend them and said suggestions they carried any racist implications were \"absurd\" and \"laughable\". He's also tried to make light of his comments, saying that bongo bongo land isn't real but if he's offended anyone there he'll apologise personally. He appears bullish and says he speaks for ordinary people who are unrepresented by the current system. The comments are embarrassing for UKIP as they come just days before the party is due to publish its list of approved candidates for next year's European elections. Leader Nigel Farage has pledged to purge UKIP of intolerance and racism. Critics will argue that, if he's serious about that, he must now show that applies to everyone in his party. \"To buy Ray-Ban sunglasses, apartments in Paris, Ferraris and all the rest of it that goes with most of the foreign aid. \"F18s for Pakistan. We need a new squadron of F18s. Who's got the squadrons? Pakistan, where we send the money.\" Questioned on the BBC News Channel, Mr Bloom, MEP for Yorkshire and Northern Lincolnshire, said it would be \"absurd\" and \"ridiculous\" to label his comments racist. He said Bongo Bongo Land was \"a figment of people's imagination. It's like Ruritania or the Third World\". He added: \"It's sad how anybody can be offended by a reference to a country that doesn't exist.\" Mr Bloom told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"If I've offended anybody in Bongo Bongo Land I will write to their ambassador at the Court of St James.\" The government has protected the international aid budget from spending cuts. Mr Bloom said: \"What I would argue is that it is for the individual citizen, it's not for the likes of David Cameron to pick up our pockets and send money to the charities of his choice. \"If I want to send money to charity, I will do it of my own accord.\" Mr Bloom said there were \"people in this country who can't get treatment for cancer, there are people who are waiting in the queue for dialysis machines\" and that \"charity begins at home\". However, party chairman Mr Crowther told Sky News: \"In my opinion it Bongo Bongo Land is a rather outdated description of foreign parts. \"To me it doesn't sound like anybody banging drums. It sounds like a shorthand way of saying places around the world which are in receipt of foreign aid. \"It's not in itself the right word to use and it could seem disparaging to people who come from foreign countries and that's why I've asked him not to do it again.\" Mr Crowther told the BBC: : \"It is lazy language, it is old-fashioned, and it is not language we want to hear used by our senior party members. That is a mistake Godfrey has made and he will not make it again.\" For Labour, shadow international development minister Rushanara Ali said: \"These are an offensive and narrow-minded set of remarks.\" She added: \"If Nigel Farage is serious about getting rid of racism and intolerance in his party, he should take action against UKIP politicians who think it's acceptable to refer to developing countries as 'Bongo Bongo Land'.\" Laura Pidcock, from campaign group Show Racism the Red Card, told Today that \"these crude stereotypes that see Britain as a civilised place and overseas as tribal\" were \"incredibly damaging\". The annual accounts for the Department for International Development show that \u00a3203.1m was spent on Pakistan in 2012-13. They state that the largest amount of the money of 31.4% was spent on education, benefiting nearly two million schoolchildren, 21.1% on tackling \"poverty, hunger and vulnerability\", 14.2% on humanitarian aid - such as flood assistance, 12.6% on reproductive, maternal and newborn health and the rest on global partnerships, governance and security (including elections), health and wealth creation. In 2010, Mr Bloom, a former investment manager, was ejected from the European Parliament for directing a Nazi slogan at a German colleague. And in 2011, he said small firms would have to be \"stark staring mad\" to hire young women because of the risk of them taking maternity leave at a later stage.", "text": ["Godfrey", "Bloom", "was",

Each team is a franchise with an \"owner\". \"Film stars like Shah Rukh Khan buy cricket teams,\" says Dey. \"Why can't we do the same? I am proud we have 16 teams and all 16 sold.\" The amounts are modest - Rs 7,000 (\u00c2\u00a370; $99) a team but the social validation matters. One franchise owner is a retired bank manager, one a painter. One has named the team after his late mother. Sitting in the club room, Buddhadev Haldar, the wiry 17-year-old defender for the Durbar Sports Academy, one of the finalists, says he had to get used to being called names. \"People would say we have come from that place. Our mothers were no good. I would feel very alone.\" Mushtaq Gazi, 14, with the Basirhat team says: \"We had to teach ourselves football. We didn't have a proper coach. We didn't have a real field to play in. When we played in the village, people would say nasty things.\" Their friend Sonu Kundu says they were told to keep their heads down, go to school, study and come back. Football, he says, broke the ice. Now other students come to the matches and cheer them on, while teachers give them time off for practice. Kundu's mother Swapna put him in a hostel at the age of three even though it broke her heart. \"He would cry and I'd bring him back home for 15 days and then take him back. It was double expense, but I didn't want him to stay where I worked. I was afraid he'd become bad.\" She does not get to see him play often because she cannot leave the small rice hotel she runs in Kolkata's red light district. \"But it gives me great pleasure to see him on the field,\" she says touching her heart. \"I have raised him with great difficulty, you see.\" As the game begins, Prabir Ray, one of the team owners, gathers his boys in a circle for a pep talk. \"There are many elders watching this game. No foul play, no foul language,\" he tells them. In a way it's much more than a football match. It is an examination of sorts, a rite of passage for these boys to the mainstream. An assortment of celebrities have gathered to watch them, from old football legends like Chuni Goswami and PK Banerjee to a soap opera star to the Personnel Officer of Calcutta Tramways. The field isn't much, dusty, without a blade of grass, \"as bald as my head\" quips 79-year old Banerjee. But football has opened doors for these boys. At least seven or eight have gone on to play for the West Bengal state team and even for India's Under-15 and Under-16 teams. A few went for special training to Manchester United in England. Dr Smarajit Jana, the public health scientist who founded DMSC in 1995, says a Danish club has invited the boys to train with them but they need to raise the money for their travel. The boys, without fail, say they want to be big footballers. \"My hero is Messi,\" says Gazi, despite his Cristiano Ronaldo backpack. But it won't be easy. They lack a proper diet. They have more will power than facilities. \"But we are used to challenges,\" says Ms Dey. Once, she says, no one thought sex workers could be health workers as well. \"But we showed them we could do it. Now it's the turn of our sons.\" As the boys get their medals, she shares her own secret dream. \"We used to have a girls football team too. But the mothers showed little interest then. I want to revive it. Some day soon.\"", "text": ["More", "than", "half", "are", "women", ".", "The", "eastern", "Indian", "city", "of", "Kolkata", "(", "Calcutta", ")", "is", "crazy", "about", "football", "but", "this",

counter-cultural event of the decade. Led Zeppelin, Bob Dylan, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones were all said to have been influenced by the psychedelic folk rock of the band, who played \"world music\" a decade before the term was coined. Comedian and banjo-player Billy Connolly, who was a massive fan and who got to know them when they played the folk clubs of Glasgow, described the band as \"hairy, exotic and interesting\". The story of how a group of folkies playing the Crown Bar in Edinburgh and late night clubs in Glasgow's Sauchiehall Street rose to become musical pioneers, who are still revered around the world, is told in a new book by the Incredible String Band's Mike Heron and long-time fan Andrew Greig. Heron begins the story by telling how a middle-class, private school-boy was looking for an escape through music. After playing in a rock 'n' roll covers band he got into folk music because he wanted to be a songwriter and \"people in folk clubs actually listen to the words\". Heron hooked up with established folk scene stars Robin Williamson and Clive Palmer as the Incredible String Band began to break out of its folk roots. He says his band-mates were very much part of the beatnik scene, open to influences from all over the world. \"Clive was ultimate Beatnik,\" Heron says. \"He lived in a tent pitched in a flat. He started off busking in Paris and he was grooved into it. Robin was too.\" Heron on the other hand was still living with his parents, who were pushing him to continue his training as a chartered accountant. He says he admired Robin and Clive: \"I was a bit like their apprentice at first. \"They were into Eastern mystic thought and all that kind of thing.\" At first the band played a mix of British folk, bluegrass and old-time jug band music. But the music quickly progressed as they wrote their own songs and brought in influences from India (they'd seen Ravi Shankar in Edinburgh), Afghanistan, Morocco and even Bulgaria. Heron says: \"We were listening to all these things but there was no-one playing the kind of thing we wanted to listen to, a composite kind of thing. \"We just played the kind of music people would like to sit around and have a joint to, interesting music that was made up of all these influences that seemed to be cool to the beatniks. \"We kind of invented this kind of music we wanted to listen to.\" The music caught the ear of American record company scout Joe Boyd, who was looking to set up a UK branch of Elektra Records. He had stumbled across Robin and Clive in early 1965 and returned a year later to sign them up. By this time Heron had joined and they had become singer-songwriters. Boyd liked what he heard. He has previously said: \"Their lyrics turned out to be witty, romantic and literate, and the melodies soared. They had also started taking LSD, so were ahead of the zeitgeist curve.\" The Incredible String Band went to London, recorded their first album and immediately split up. Heron says: \"When the money trickled in from the first album and the three of us got an advance, Robin and Clive just took off. \"Robin just went immediately to Morocco and didn't come back. Because people just did that in those days. \"Clive went off to Afghanistan for a good six months. \"Nowadays that seems amazing that a band has just made its first album and two of them toddle off around the world. \"I was astonished. I was not really a beatnik. I thought that was it, the band was over.\" According to Heron, Clive never really came back. He was not really interested in the band. Robin Williamson only returned to Edinburgh when the money dried up and the pair resumed ISB as a duo. When Williamson did return he was laden with Moroccan instruments, including a gimbri. Their second album The 5000 Spirits or the Layers of the Onion, which came out in 1967, was cited much later by David Bowie as one of the best albums ever. It has been described by critics as the Summer of Love condensed into one album. Its opening track, Chinese White, was the first time Andrew Greig had heard of ISB and it \"blew my mind\". From the weird North African instrument in the opening bars to the lyric which states: \"The bent twig of darkness/Grows the petals of the morning/It shows to them the birds singing/Just behind the dawning\", the whole thing was a revelation to a 16-year-old school boy from Anstruther in Fife. Greig says: \"I was a fan out in the provinces and lots of people around about me were turned on, there is no other word for it, by the band. \"There were no drugs available in East Fife at the time. The music just astonished us. \"There was a school folk club that was doing fairly earnest American protest songs and Scottish folk songs, there was also the Beatles and The Stones, which we loved, but we had never heard anything like Chinese White.\" Greig says: \"The fact that they were Scottish and cutting edge, that's what liberated us to think, 'well if they can do it, we can do something like that'. It gave us permission.\" The young boy from Fife formed a band in the image of the String Band called Fate & Ferret. He says: \"We adopted their manner of dress and walked around the back-country in Fife with flutes and whistles and mandolins and sausages and cider. \"It was curiously innocent in a way. We had this idea of being travelling troubadours. It was that medieval and rural vibe.\" Greig, who has had a successful career as a writer, wanted to use his experiences with the band to \"memorialise\" the Sixties. His book - You Know What You Could Be - takes its title from one of Heron's early String Band songs. Its lyrics sum up Greig's feelings about growing up in the Sixties: \"You know what you could be/Tell me my friend/Why you worry all the time/What you should be\". He says: \"It was that kind of liberation call. \"My story and Mike's are both of people trying to become who they need to be when you don't actually know who that is yet. \"They are both stories of formation. The ridiculous and often comic process by which you try to become who you need to be.\" In the book Mike Heron only tells the ISB story up to the point where Greig takes over. However, there was much more to come including a trip to Woodstock, the famous festival in upstate New York in 1969 that has become one of the most iconic events in music history. Heron says: \"It was brilliant to be there but it was very primitive.\" He says the roads to the site were so choked up that they had to be flown in by a military helicopter. \"It was open at the side and the pilot kept going sideways so we could see these huge crowds below. Ravi Shankar was on the plane with us. He was not very relaxed.\" The band were supposed to have played on the Friday but it was pouring with rain and they were afraid they would be electrocuted. The band were asked to play an acoustic set but by this time their girlfriends were in the band and Heron says it would have been \"unchivalrous\" to leave them out. Instead they played in the baking heat of the Saturday. Heron, who is now 74, says: \"It was very tricky to play there. \"The stage was high and rickety so that didn't help. The music we were playing was quite delicate so when we went on on the Saturday it was a bit rowdy. \"Everyone had been dropping assorted drugs. They wanted things like Canned Heat. They didn't want plinky, British, thoughtful music. It was too floaty. It wasn't really what was required.\" The Incredible String Band split in 1974 but reunited for occasional performances from 1997 to 2006. Andrew Greig says it is \"astonishing\" to be friends with and write a book with the man whose band he idolised as a 16-year-old in Fife. He says: \"On one level he is a god, a myth, a legend, an inspiration of my youth . \"On the other hand he is a guy who I spend time with, who I eat curry with. It's an odd experience but a lovely one.\" You Know What You Could Be by Mike Heron and Andrew Greig will be published by riverrun on 6 April", "text": ["Their", "incredible", "journey", "took",

conjoining of the two silver F1 cars, and Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg ended up in the gravel at Turn Four on the first lap of the Spanish Grand Prix, each nursing their own resentment, even if they tried to hide it afterwards. The Mercedes media management system went into overdrive to try to contain the fall-out from the crash that handed the race to Red Bull and ended in the marketing dream of an 18-year-old winning his first grand prix for the team. But the effects of this incident will reverberate through the rest of this already compelling F1 season. The seeds of this incident go right back to another collision between Hamilton and Rosberg in the 2014 Belgian Grand Prix, which itself was an example of pressure building to a point at which it could no longer be contained. After that crash, Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff was apoplectic and made it clear to both drivers that it must never happen again, that their first responsibility was to make sure they go to the end of the race and never endanger the possibility of the team winning. This time, Wolff admitted to being \"angry and upset\" but the tone was very different. Then, blame was laid squarely on Rosberg's \"unacceptable conduct\". Now, it was \"a very unfortunate racing incident, triggered by various circumstances\". In large part, that is a reflection of Wolff's fundamental honesty. In Spa, Rosberg was clearly to blame. In Barcelona on Sunday, it was much less clear-cut. The background, and the fundamental reason for the crash, was that Rosberg has had a clean run of four victories in the first four races of this season, and Hamilton has hit various problems. That meant Rosberg arrived in Spain with a 43-point lead over Hamilton in the championship, and the world champion was determined not to let it get any bigger. Hamilton took an absolutely brilliant pole position, one of his very best, rewriting the boundaries of what was possible in a way that left many in the paddock aghast - including his team-mate. His start was good, but so was Rosberg's, and the German drafted Hamilton down to Turn One and passed him around the outside with a fantastic manoeuvre, the sort he has so rarely been able to pull off. At that moment, as Rosberg admitted later, he felt he was \"about to win that race\", so difficult is passing on the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya. Hamilton knew it, too, so when he saw Rosberg's engine \"de-rating\" - running out of hybrid boost indicted by a flashing red light on the back of his car in Turn Three because the German had it on the wrong setting - he saw an opportunity to pounce. Rosberg was a little on the inside of the normal line but Hamilton knew he had to go for the inside, at a closing speed of an extra 17km/h, it was revealed later. Rosberg moved to defend but Hamilton kept coming. TV pictures showed that Hamilton had his front wing alongside Rosberg's rear wheel while both were still on the track. In theory, that means the defending driver has to leave a car's width of space. But Rosberg was coming across so fast that it was all a blur. Hamilton took to the grass, lost control, spun and hit his team-mate going backwards, both then careering into the gravel trap. Listen to Hamilton and Rosberg crash Hamilton said: \"I was gaining on him at fairly decent pace and where he positioned the car was a car width to the right of the racing line and I had to decide whether to go left or right. \"The inside is always what you'd go for; there was a much bigger gap. I had part of my wing and wheel alongside within the white line and then that diminished pretty quickly. \"I did what I could to avoid an incident by going on the grass but it all happened pretty quickly. \"It wasn't a case of 'the door was closed but I decided to go across the grass'. I saw a gap and went for it and that's what racing drivers do.\" Rosberg said: \"I saw Lewis closing in, so as soon as I could I closed the door to the inside with a clear strong move to make sure he understands there is not going to be space there and I was very surprised that he went for it anyway. That's it. Then we were in the sand trap. \"In the end, we have to go with what the experts think and the experts have decided it was a racing incident.\" Technically, Rosberg had breached article 27.7 of the sporting regulations, which requires the leading driver to leave room if there is a \"significant proportion of the car attempting to pass alongside\". And, technically, one view could be that Hamilton had caused a collision, which is also against the rules. Another TV still, taken shortly before the one we have already mentioned, showed Hamilton still clearly behind and Rosberg angling steeply to the inside - at which point many might have backed out of it. But the stewards decided not to penalise either driver, a conclusion based on the speed at which circumstances unfolded. Rosberg \"defended his position, as is his right,\" they said. Hamilton \"had a portion of his front wing inside Rosberg fractions of a second prior to having to leave the track to avoid an initial collision, which may have led him to believe he had the right to space on the right\". \"Once on the grass, Hamilton was no longer in control of the situation.\" The conclusion was that Rosberg \"had the right\" to do what he did and Hamilton's \"attempt to overtake was reasonable\". Now, some might view that as a fudge, especially as Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo, right behind, said: \"From what I saw, Rosberg didn't give him room but it happened very quickly so I won't say any more.\" But as Wolff put it: \"When we looked at the incident, there are quite some many people in the team with racing experience and an opinion, and it differed between all of us. What I take home is it is an incident that could have been avoided from both sides.\" Of the two drivers, Rosberg was the one who, judging by appearances, seemed more angry. Do they need clear-the-air talks, he was asked? \"It is something I need to think about in the days to come,\" he replied. \"I can't tell you now. I am just extremely gutted because it was my race to win and I am not just gutted for myself.\" When Hamilton was asked whether it changed the dynamic between him and Rosberg, he replied: \"It doesn't change anything. We just keep racing, try to make sure it doesn't happen again.\" Was the incident triggered because Rosberg had less to lose, given his championship advantage, and Hamilton is under pressure to make up ground? \"Subconsciously maybe,\" Wolff said, \"but I am not Dr Freud and it is difficult to judge whether that played a role.\" Another way of looking at it, though, is that, actually, Hamilton had every bit as much reason not to back down as Rosberg. Yes, a crash maintained Rosberg's points lead. But equally Hamilton had lost the lead, and will have known that the first lap was his best opportunity to pass, and that if they both finished he would lose a further seven points to his team-mate. That is not to suggest that either did anything deliberately to precipitate a collision; it is merely an illustration of the stakes involved. Those stakes have just been raised considerably. Hamilton has less time to close a still considerable gap; Rosberg has made it clear he will not be intimidated. Mercedes have emphasised such a thing must not happen again. But ultimately they are as good as powerless to prevent it. Wolff said he felt further discussions were not necessary, that the \"pain\" of losing 43 points was \"lesson enough\". \"You can't expect them to be easy about it,\" Wolff said. \"Each will have an opinion. But I am 100% sure it won't influence their relationship negatively going forward.\" Not everyone will be quite so sure about that.

"And the smartphone is to blame, says Dr Sharon McDonald, a reader in computing at the University of Sunderland. \"In theory, people can now make better use of what might have previously been 'dead time' - for example, making notes during the daily commute. \"Thus productivity apps tie in with the basic notion of increasing productivity by using one's time in a smarter way.\" The sector is expected to be worth $58bn (\u00c2\u00a337bn) globally by 2016, according to app research firm VisionMobile. And research from software company Salesforce.com last year suggested such apps can boost worker productivity by more than 34%. But are they really more hype than help? They're a \"massive\" waste of time, thinks Crawford Warnock, managing director of PR and communications agency, Firstname Communications. \"I have used Evernote, Outlook, reminders on the iPhone, Procraster and stacks of others. They all follow the same pattern - enthusiastic use and exploration followed by a moment of frustration, and then they fall off.\" He is not alone in experiencing app exasperation. Yet others swear by them. David Carr, strategy director at marketing and technology agency, Digitas LBi, says he is \"addicted\" to Evernote, the popular cloud-based app designed for note taking, archiving, and collaboration. Having stuck doggedly with Delicious - the social bookmarking service - to store links to interesting articles, the experience became \"so bad\" that he fell into the arms of Evernote. \"Now I'm addicted to it. It has transformed how I capture thoughts, insights and articles. I've become a taxonomy geek happily tagging everything I come across for later recall.\" There is discontinuity in how employees work as they move away from their desk Mr Carr has set up nearly 2,000 tags for his saved content and expects to add many more. \"It lets me get on with the actual thinking and collaborating rather than chasing down elusive examples,\" he says. But Jon Cunningham, consultant at business development agency, Hob-Nob New Business, takes an opposing view. \"Evernote became an unmanageable beast,\" he says. \"Too many search variables, and too difficult to discern the important and urgent from everything else.\" Instead, he was seduced by the charms of Trello, a project management app that uses \"cards\" and \"boards\" to segment projects and allocate tasks between colleagues. It has won his heart - for now - chiefly enabling him to operate an \"empty email inbox policy\". \"I can forward emails to a Trello inbox then allocate the job to another person ...it's a much more useful tool for getting things done,\" he says. Tom Roberts, managing director of Tribal Worldwide London, goes so far as to say that Trello runs his life. \"Right now, we have a large pitch on and we are using Trello to run and orchestrate the entire process. For me it's less about time saving, exactly, and more about achieving more during the working day.\" But the smartphone has also become a double-edged sword, facilitating the \"always on\" culture and eating into our leisure time. And Jonathan Green, a director at consultancy KPMG, says that while many productivity apps are \"profoundly useful at an individual level\", they have limited benefits for employees of larger organisations due to lack of integration with existing IT systems. \"It means there is discontinuity in how employees work as they move away from their desk,\" he says. This lack of integration also raises data security issues, something LBi's Mr Carr acknowledges. He says he and some of his colleagues are using the Evernote app via a personal, free or premium account, which has security implications because they are not specifically designed for business. \"While we wouldn't use the service for highly sensitive material, this does mean that non-critical information, even if it is raw notes, recordings or web links, is being stored on US servers.\" This means the data could theoretically be nabbed by US authorities under the USA Patriot Act. And with the recent decision by the European Court of Justice to tear up the Safe Harbour data-sharing agreement between the US and Europe, businesses need to be even more alert as to where and how their potentially sensitive data is being stored. Despite such drawbacks, there is an undoubted thirst for tech that helps - or seems to help - make our working lives easier. Take Slack, for example, a popular real-time messaging app that spans desktop and mobile. Alex Hamilton, chief executive of Radiant Law, a corporate law firm with offices in London and Cape Town, says his firm adopted the app to help tackle the deluge of emails. \"We have pretty much got rid of internal emails,\" he says. \"The ability to channel discussions is very powerful, and the ability for anyone to join open conversations has helped us really boost transparency across the firm. \"Most of all, it's just really easy to use and people like using it.\" Fun and simplicity seem to be key to a productivity app's success. \"Like any good relationship, you have to commit fully to your chosen productivity app as it's easy to slip out of using it when the honeymoon period is over,\" says Jason Cartwright, boss of web development agency, Potato. He is a fan of both Trello and Slack. But try telling that to Crawford Warnock. He maintains that his best investment has been a wallboard \"and more pens\".", "text": ["And", "the", "smartphone", "is", "to", "blame", ",", "says", "Dr", "Sharon", "McDonald", ",", "a", "reader",

perhaps, but understandable given the circumstances. Nagelsmann was just 28 and had never coached at senior level, while Hoffenheim, a village with a population of just 3,300 in southern Germany, were deep in relegation trouble, seven points from safety and running out of games. What has followed in the past nine months is impressive. Not only did Nagelsmann secure the club's Bundesliga place, but he has also seen his side move up to third in the table this season and become one of only five teams in Europe's five major leagues to remain unbeaten. So, how has a managerial novice born in 1987 managed to transform Hoffenheim from relegation strugglers to a top-three side? BBC Sport looks at the 29-year-old who has taken the German top flight by storm. Long before he landed the head coach role at the club, Nagelsmann had already earned the nickname 'Baby Mourinho'. It was given to him by former Hoffenheim and Germany goalkeeper Tim Wiese as Nagelsmann was making a name for himself after the defender's career was cut short by persistent knee problems. Like Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho, Naglesmann did not make it as a top player. Aged 20, he was forced to end a promising career while in Augsburg's second team, coached by Thomas Tuchel, who is now manager at Borussia Dortmund. Nagelsmann then worked under Tuchel before moving to Hoffenheim via coaching 1860 Munich's Under-17s. He then appeared on Bayern Munich's radar after masterminding Hoffenheim's German Under-19 Championship triumph in 2014, but he opted to stay at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena. And his appointment as head coach came six years after arriving at the Sinsheim-based club. \"I assumed a big deal would made about my age when I was appointed,\" Nagelsmann told BBC Sport. \"If you are appointed a boss of an established economic enterprise at the age of 28, this also would be a big story.\" Hoffenheim had two wins from 20 games when Nagelsmann took charge nine months ago. They were next to bottom in the table and seven points from guaranteed safety. Local newspaper Rhein-Neckar-Zeitung labelled his appointment a public relations stunt. \"I don't blame them,\" Hoffenheim's director of football Alexander Rosen said. \"You look at Julian's age. He had already been here six years so we knew what he was able to do. \"He has a natural feeling for the group, he brings energy, passion and is blessed with talent.\" Hoffenheim won seven of the remaining 14 games to finish one point above the relegation play-off spot. \"Straight away the team bought into my ideas and the way I would like to play football,\" added Nagelsmann, who lists Johan Cruyff and Pep Guardiola as his footballing heroes. Hoffenheim had announced in October 2015 that the youth coach would take over as manager in the summer of 2016, provided they stayed up. However, Nagelsmann was fast-tracked into the job with three months of the season remaining when experienced boss Hubb Stevens resigned because of a heart complaint. And Nagelsmann's sense of technical know-how and ability to man-manage has converted critics into admirers. \"He had some experience in coaching but not as a head coach,\" said Joachim Klaehn, who covers Hoffenheim for the Rhein-Neckar-Zeitung newspaper. \"Before Julian was appointed, they were in big trouble. They were bottom of the table during the winter break and everybody thought they would go down as they had no match plan. \"But it has been a sensation under Julian. He is a local hero.\" With Hoffenheim's place in the Bundesliga secured, Nagelsmann got to work on rebuilding the squad in the summer. Incomings included Croatia forward Andrej Kramaric, 25, who turned a loan from Leicester City into a permanent move, midfielders Lukas Rupp, 25, from Stuttgart and Kevin Vogt, 25, from Cologne, plus former Bayern Munich forward Sandro Wagner, 28, from Darmstadt. Hoffenheim have scored in all but two of their 24 league games under Nagelsmann and even took the lead at champions Bayern Munich, managed by three-time Champions League winner Carlo Ancelotti. \"I have great respect for a coach like Ancelotti. Every coach dreams of being able to celebrate only a fraction of his achievements,\" added Nagelsmann, who was raised in the Bavarian village of Issing. Since their young coach took charge, Hoffenheim have taken 43 points in 24 matches. But Rosen warned there will be times in the future when it may not be so rosy. \"He is an extraordinary talent,\" he said. \"However, we have to keep in mind the possibility that we will lose two or three games in a row. We have to be careful we give Julian the air to breathe when things are not going well. \"Let's not forget he has had 26 league and cup games as head coach, he is still learning.\" How has Nagelsmann's appointment gone down with the senior players in the dressing room? For starters, Hoffenheim have no major stars in their team after Roberto Firmino left for Liverpool in June 2015. Instead they have assembled a squad of hard-working individuals, with the club operating a policy of signing young talent. That means only three players are older than the head coach - second-choice goalkeeper Alexander Stolz, 33, Poland midfielder Eugen Polanski, 30, while Switzerland midfielder Pirmin Schwegler is 136 days older than his boss. \"We have eight players from our own academy in the first team squad,\" added Rosen. \"For the past three years we have had the youngest squad in the Bundesliga.\" Relaxed off the training pitch, Nagelsmann has been accused of being the opposite in his technical area. Bayer Leverkusen head coach Roger Schmidt was banned and fined after calling his opposite number a \"nutcase\" during a game in October. \"I act out my emotions on the sidelines. I am also a very impulsive person and very involved in the speech to my players, but only as far as motivation is concerned,\" he added. \"I do not yell at my players because they made a mistake or rage in the dressing room,\" Nagelsmann said. \"Of course, sometimes you get angry or your voice gets louder when you analyse a match but everything stays within the limits.\" Hoffenheim, a former village team, were playing in the eighth tier of German football when former player Dietmar Hopp returned to buy the club in the early 1990s. Hopp brought with him his personal fortune, made from a software company, and a dream to take his former club to the top level of German football. Initial investment came in the form of modern training facilities and the large-scale development of youth academies. This provided the foundations that saw a fairytale rise through the divisions with a team made up entirely of products of the youth set-up. After rising to the second tier of German football, Hopp saw the opportunity and for the first time invested heavily in the squad and management. Former Schalke boss Ralf Rangnick was appointed boss in 2006, and subsequently helped the club to back-to-back promotions, realising Hopps' long-term vision of making Hoffenheim a Bundesliga club. This is their ninth season in Germany's top tier. The Rhein-Neckar Arena, which holds 30,000 fans, has been their home since January 2009 and is situated in the southern town of Sinsheim, which is a short car ride from Hoffenheim. Bayern Munich boss Carlo Ancelotti: \"It is rare to observe such a young coach in the job. I hope that one day he will train the best team in the world.\" Borussia Dortmund boss Thomas Tuchel: \"He's a very inquisitive and very hardworking young coach. He has enjoyed exceptional successes in youth football. I'm very happy for him and I believe in him.\" Hoffenheim director of football Alexander Rosen: \"Julian is 29 and I am 37. We have a combined age younger than Arsene Wenger! Hoffenheim's 76-year-old owner Dietmar Hopp: \"He's so good that I wonder if we can keep him. It would be best if we could keep him for a long time, at least as long as I live, and I hope that's quite a long time.\" Although Nagelsmann is the youngest permanent head coach in Bundesliga history, he is not the youngest to oversee a Bundesliga match. That honour belongs to Bernd Stober who was just 24 when he took charge of Saarbrucken in an interim capacity for their trip to Cologne on 23 October 1976. His side lost 5-1. In Europe's other major leagues, Crystal Palace put Attilio Lombardo in charge at the age of 32 years and 67 days in 1998, while Lippo Hertzka had just turned 26 when he was appointed Real Madrid boss in 1930. In France, Henri Cammarata was 29 years and 11 days old when he took charge of his first Toulouse match in 1945. Former England striker David Platt was 32 years and 187 days old when he was appointed by Sampdoria in December 1998. Nagelsmann was born on 23 July 1987.

again to 2014 and the characters have been revived for the big screen by DreamWorks in Mr Peabody and Sherman. This time, in the hands of The Lion King director Rob Minkoff. Modern Family star Ty Burrell provides the voice of Peabody - a talking dog, business titan, inventor, scientist, Nobel laureate, gourmand, and two-time Olympic medallist. The cast also included the voices of Burrell's on-screen Modern Family daughter Ariel Winter, Stanley Tucci and comedy stars Stephen Colbert, Leslie Mann and Mel Brooks. \"It was important to us from the beginning to be as authentic as possible to capture the spirit of the original but for a new audience,\" says director Minkoff. It was originally created by US television-animation legend Jay Ward, who also came up with characters like George of the Jungle and Dudley Do-Right. Each short segment saw Peabody and Sherman use his WABAC (or Wayback) machine to travel through time to visit historical figures such as Napoleon, Lord Nelson and Leonardo Da Vinci. \"I think Rob and DreamWorks have done a very good job in being very respectful to the original series,\" says Burrell. \"We've been working with Jay Ward's estate and his daughter Tiffany and they gave us the thumbs up after seeing it which was a big relief.\" Burrell, 46, is best known to TV audiences as the well meaning but clumsy \"cool, dad\" Phil Dunphy in the hit US series Modern Family - a role for which he has won one Emmy and been nominated for three more. \"I had done some TV voice work and I've done some commercial voice work but this is my first feature film and I tried to enter into it with my ears and eyes opening in terms of learning,\" he explains. \"I wanted to be respectful of Bill Scott who was the original voice and pay homage to him but also it's important that I create my own voice. \"The first voice was essentially me imitating Bill which is completely unsustainable because he is in such a higher register than me, I have a very deep voice, so that was ill-advised and then slowly it worked back down, still erudite but maybe less glib.\" Burrell was not the first choice for Peabody, he took over from Robert Downey Jr - who was announced back in 2011. But Minkoff has nothing but praise for his new leading man. \"It was the balance of his intellect and rationality but we also wanted to show his heart and warmth, even though it's central to his character that he has trouble expressing his emotions,\" he says. At the core of the story is the relationship between a father and his adopted son, albeit in this case a role reversal of the relationship between a boy and his dog. A key scene shows Sherman, upon being told that, as the son of a dog he must himself be a canine, reacting by biting one of his school classmates. Burrell says the story has resonance personally as the father to two adopted daughters. \"I have two young girls, I have an adoptive relationship which was another meaningful part of taking this job,\" he says. \"Their love for each other as father and son becomes the most important thing to both of them. Peabody wants to be a good dad and Sherman ultimately loves his dad and wants to be a good son.\" For his part, Mr Peabody and Sherman is Minkoff's first full-length animated feature since 1994's The Lion King - still the second biggest grossing animated movie of all time, with takings of more than $422m. The huge box office success of recent animations like Despicable Me 2 and Frozen, agrees Minkoff, is why we are in a \"golden age\" of animation. \"I think because the technology has raced ahead and made so many things possible,\" he explains. \"But for audiences, animation is going through this era of being accepted. People are enjoying animated films in numbers that are unprecedented. \"As long as the audiences are there, more will be made,\" he adds. In 2011, The Lion King was retro-fitted in 3D and re-released in cinemas. Mr Peabody and Sherman will be available to audiences in both 2D and 3D. With recent evidence suggesting that 3D audiences in Britain are dropping off, Minkoff insists that animation in particular is almost always improved by the new technology. \"I really enjoy 3D, which is to say that it is a wonderful medium and certain films are fantastic to watch in 3D. \"I don't necessarily think all films should be watched in 3D but I do think that it can be a fun more experiential kind of thing. \"I think the animation works well because it's fantasy, it's abstract. We look at it and we know it's not the real world but we want to be a part of it and 3D puts you in that world.\" The film, which opens in the UK on 7 February, marks the beginning of a busy year for Burrell. Soon to be seen opposite the Muppets in their new film Muppets Most Wanted, and in Finding Dory, the sequel to Finding Nemo, Burrell also returns to the Modern Family fold, now in its fifth season. Since it began in 2009, the show has made household names of Burrell and his co-stars. But despite their boosted profiles and star salaries, he insists that no-one is looking to jump ship to chase that big Hollywood payday. \"Every year, you come back and everybody is still hungry, I think that's the main thing and it's such a pleasant surprise. Not a surprise but a great feeling to come back to work and still have people so excited to be there.\" Prior to Modern Family, Burrell was himself a jobbing actor, whose biggest roles were opposite Nicole Kidman in Fur and Zack Snyder's 2004 remake of zombie classic Dawn of the Dead. He says most of the cast, barring Ed O'Neill who starred in the US TV classic Married... With Children, were in the same boat. \"Everybody was working but we hadn't experienced anything like Modern Family so we don't have anybody on the show who is chomping at the bit to get on to something else, because we'd all been around for a long time and we know what it's like out there. \"If you're the cast of Friends and you have a level of success then there must be a part of you that would be like, 'Is this holding me back?' But there's none of that on this show, everybody is just lucky enough to do projects in our off-season, films and stuff but we would do this show for 20 years if they let us.\" Mr Peabody & Sherman

Joanna Parker and Paul Drinkhall are the singles entrants for Britain. Joanna is a solid defensive player, Paul has a strong forehand and is an ex-European junior champion. China's Zhang Jike is the reigning men's World Cup winner and world champion, and is looking to add the Olympic title. China sweep the medals, but in tournaments their athletes can crack under pressure.\" The sport's appeal is obvious: it's fast, fun and cheap. At elite level, it's really fast. The ball travels at speeds of 100mph and is struck more than 180 times in a minute - about three shots a second. The Chinese dominate the global game (they have won all five titles at each of the last four World Championships), and the proliferation of China-born players representing other countries has raised the standard. There are four table tennis events held at the Olympics: the men's and women's singles, and men's and women's team events, which replaced the doubles at the last Olympics. As table tennis is an incredibly fast sport, an hour's play can burn approximately 272 calories. Due to its intensity, table tennis improves cardiovascular fitness, endurance levels and the health of an athlete's heart. One of the main benefits of playing table tennis is that it is non-contact. This means you can get all the positives of a high-energy sport such as football without the risk of collision injuries to the arms, shoulders and legs. It is also one of the few competitive sports that requires players to move at speed without straining the muscles or joints through stretching or using heavy equipment. For people returning from injury or the elderly, table tennis tennis can be the perfect sport to sustain fitness levels. The action of having to hit a fast-moving ball with a bat several times a second means table tennis also improves reflexes, eye-to-hand co-ordination, mental alertness and speed of movement. Table tennis is a cheap and accessible sport played by 2.4m people in the United Kingdom. For people of all ages and abilities, table tennis clubs provide the best place to learn and play the sport. There are currently more than 750 clubs in gyms, leisure centres, schools, colleges and universities throughout the UK. To find your nearest club, visit the English Table Tennis Association,Irish Table Tennis,Table Tennis Association of Wales or Table Tennis Scotland websites. Table tennis equipment, such as bats and ping-pong balls, can be relatively inexpensive to buy, with some leisure centres and clubs also offering a rental service. Hourly rates for hiring a court often begin at approximately \u00a35 per session, although membership deals can create a lower cost per game. In England, Ping! is an innovative three year street ping pong project which provides people with opportunities to play social and competitive table tennis, free of charge. Permanent outdoors free-to-use table tennis tables have also been installed in parks in places such as London, Birmingham, Bristol and Hull. 'Join In Local Sport' aims to get as many people as possible to turn up and take part in activities at their local sports facilities on 18/19 August, 2012 - the first weekend between the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The aim of the initiative is for every sports club and community group in the UK to put on a special event in a bid to encourage more people to get involved as members, supporters or volunteers. More than 4,000 local sports clubs will be opening their doors to host events and show people just how they can get involved. As well as tips on playing sport there will be information on coaching, supporting and how to help out. Find an event near you. Get your performance under pressure analysed in just 20 minutes by four-time Olympic gold medallist Michael Johnson Start the experiment More on the London 2012 website A point is scored in a variety of ways, including when a player allows the ball to bounce twice on their side of the table, hits the ball into the net and outside the boundaries of the table without bouncing. Sweden's Jan-Ove Waldner dropped just one game in seven matches when winning the 1992 men's singles gold - living up to his nickname of the 'Mozart of Table Tennis' The first player or pair scoring 11 points (by a margin of two clear points) wins the game. If the scores are tied at 10-10 then it is the player or the pair that gains a lead of two points first who wins the game. The expedite system can be introduced if a set has not finished after 10 minutes. Under the expedite system, each player makes a service and if the receiving player or pair makes 13 good returns, the receiver shall score a point. The service is changed after every two points. Once the score gets to 10-10, the serve changes after every point. In doubles matches, the serve alternates between players as well as teams. Players also take turns to hit the ball, with one hit allowed per player before it alternates. More on the Team GB website London major Boris Johnson proudly declared after Beijing that \"whiff-whaff is coming home\". However, the medals will not be following. Paul Drinkhall plays in the men's singles, Joanna Parker in the women's, and both will find the going tough. The teams are also unlikely to go far. Gold should be all about the Chinese. Wang Hao and world champion Zhang Jike should contest the men's final, while Ding Ning and Li Xiaoxia are the two top women. China also look unbeatable in the team competitions. Germany are the best European outfit and will be looking for medals from the men's team and Timo Boll. In the late 19th century table tennis was a sedate after-dinner pastime among the high society in England and British army officers abroad, with cigar-box lids used as rackets and a carved champagne cork for a ball. China has won 20 of the 24 available gold medals since table tennis became an Olympic sport Early names for the sport included gossima, whiff-whaff and ping pong. The first World Championships were held in London in 1926, but it did not become an Olympic sport until 1988 in Seoul. It is estimated there are 40 million competitive table tennis players and countless millions playing recreationally, making it the sport with the most participants worldwide.

Now, 63 years later, an attempt will be made to shatter another of sport's landmark times - a sub two-hour marathon. Bannister's mile was a triumph of Corinthian values and spirit. However, this marathon - to be run in under 120 minutes - is organised by sportswear giant Nike and the event, taking place in northern Italy on Saturday morning, has a distinctly corporate feel about it. It is the ultimate endurance test, but also one which no fans or broadcast journalists will be able to see. So is it an expensive PR and marketing exercise? Or, given its aim to knock close to three minutes off the best time anyone has ever ran 26.2 miles, should it be viewed as a laudable attempt to use sporting excellence and science to push human endurance to dizzying new heights? The world record for the marathon was set by Kenya's Dennis Kimetto in Berlin in 2014. His time of two hours two minutes 57 seconds is the closest anyone has ever come to going under two hours. However, it will be not be Kimetto stepping up to this challenge. The job lies instead with his compatriot Eliud Kipchoge, Zersenay Tadese of Eritrea and Lelisa Desisa of Ethiopia. Kipchoge, as the reigning Olympic marathon champion, perhaps has the greatest chance. His personal best of 2:03.05, set in London in 2016, is impressive and just eight seconds shy of the record. To break the two-hour marathon barrier, a runner would need to beat the fastest-ever marathon by about 3%. That means they would need to shave seven seconds off each of the race's 26.2 miles. Therefore, to go under two hours will require a substantial improvement - something that several sports scientists believe is simply beyond what is currently humanly possible. Nike don't really do perceived wisdom though. They have signed up the three elite performers, paying them to forego the London and Berlin marathons this season so they can focus their full attention on what the company has branded \"Breaking2\". Historical weather patterns have been studied and a three-day window chosen in the belief it will offer optimum conditions. It has since been narrowed further and so, at 05:45 local time on Saturday morning, the three men will set off in pursuit of a place in history, but not the record books. This is because of the use of in-out pacemakers, 20 of which will be deployed to keep the pace at a necessary level. Their use is against athletics regulations, so no matter what time is set on Saturday morning, it won't be considered a valid world record. The pacers will also work in formations to defend the three runners from head or crosswinds. In-out pacemaking is just one facet of what is a complex and expensive operation. According to Runners World magazine, several locations were scouted worldwide in search of the perfect venue. Courses in the Netherlands, Chicago and Berlin are all said to have been considered and eventually rejected. Monza, just north of Milan, is more used to hosting Formula 1 races but was finally chosen because of its gentle corners, climatic conditions and the fact it's both flat and 600ft above sea level. So 17.5 laps of a 2,400m course await. Nike's legion of scientists, performance coaches, nutritionists and medical staff are also leaving nothing to chance. Mobile ultrasound units have been used to measure glycogen levels in the runners' legs, core temperature pills (an ingestible thermometer that transmits data) are taken by the runners and the latest advances in recovery methods are in use to provide every possible chance of success. Staff on scooters will deliver energy drinks to the three runners to ensure they don't waste vital seconds slowing down or even slightly veering off course to grab them from roadside tables. And then there's the runners' kit - or, more specifically, the shoes. Nike says its own tests on a special new shoe - passed as legal by the International Association of Athletic's Federation's (IAAF) technical committee - make runners up to 4% more efficient. So is the attempt just about selling very expensive shoes? Nike's big corporate rival, Adidas, is planning its own sub two-hour marathon attempt but wants to do so in a race setting; perhaps laying claim by so doing to a greater sense of authenticity. But Nike's vice president of special projects, Sandy Bodecker, is perhaps unsurprisingly enthusiastic about the impact that going under two hours will have, even if it is under such controlled conditions. \"The sub two-hour marathon barrier is one of those rare ones that, if broken, can transform a sport,\" he says. \"It's the last big, once-in-a-generation barrier\u2026 It will impact the way runners view distance running and human potential forever.\" It's a big claim but, very much in line with a company ethos that urges elite athletes and park plodders alike to \"Just Do It.\" Others, however, are critical of the attempt given the money-no-object resources that have been thrown at it and the fact it will not count as a legitimate record. The attempt is also notable in that the world's media are being blocked from witnessing it. This is very much a behind-closed-doors event, which is unusual given the corporate fanfare it is accompanied by. There will be no fans lining the steep grandstands that are usually filled by thousands of Formula 1 tifosi on race days. It suggests that, with everything else under tight control, spectators and journalists would be a distraction from the task at hand. The very early start time, no doubt, presents logistical issues too. Instead, Nike have allowed a few hand-picked journalists to attend who have also covered the build-up to the big day. A web stream will also provide coverage of the runners on the asphalt track. Some supporters of the project have called it a \"moonshot\", given the scale of ambition and the effort expended to get to this point. So, just like Neil Armstrong's famous first step on the lunar surface in 1969, the world will be required to watch and wonder. BBC athletics commentator Ed Harry Amid the furore over proposals to not call anything pre-2005 a world record, there's some irony that we can get so excited about a race where a world record can't be set. Saturday 6 May is the preferred date, which is also the 63rd anniversary of Roger Bannister breaking the four-minute barrier for the mile. There are definite parallels. There was plenty of controversy about Bannister's attempt, just as there is about what's happening in Monza. But an athlete racing against the clock goes to the heart of what the sport has always been. If anyone can do this, it's Eliud Kipchoge.

{"raw_text": "As many Tories have pointed out, their party increased its share of the vote for the fifth election in a row, something no party has ever done before. What took everyone by surprise was the astonishing surge in support for Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party. This is driven to some extent by the UKIP vote falling back into their hands; but it seems likely to have been driven primarily by Britain's young voters. And the place where they spent the election campaign wasn't just the rallies at which Corbyn drew thousands. It was online. In new digital media. You cannot understand politics in our time unless you really understand media. There are plenty of lessons about the media that I take from this election. Here are just five. As I reported for the BBC 10 o'clock News, there have been two main narratives about this election, running in parallel. In traditional media, such as newspapers, Theresa May was lauded as a strong leader, while Jeremy Corbyn was lambasted as a socialist throwback. In many new digital and social media platforms, an alternative view was expressed: One in which the Prime Minister is a weak and wooden performer, while Corbyn is an excellent tribune of the poor. Newspapers lean right, on the whole, and tend to have an older audience. New digital media more often (though not always) leans left and often has a younger audience. Obviously these are huge generalisations; and clearly many traditional publishers also operate in the digital sphere; but the fact is, power is shifting irreversibly from old to new media. I know I keep banging on about it, but it has always amazed me how slow Westminster has been to work this out. At 68, Corbyn understood it better than most of his predecessors. Of course Fleet Street isn't a homogenous thing. It includes papers that backed Corbyn or tactical voting to stop the Tories, such as The Guardian and The Daily Mirror. For the most part, however, Britain's newspapers are conservative, and the most powerful titles, such as the Mail, Sun, Times, Telegraph and Express have been unanimous in their basic viewpoint. Last week, those newspapers got slapped in the face. No modern Prime Minister has had more sycophantic coverage than Theresa May. Even when she u-turned on her social care policy, and pretended she hadn't (\"nothing has changed\"), her move was welcomed as a pragmatic gesture. If the manifesto commitments had been the other way round, and Corbyn had announced that reform to social care and the triple lock on pensions, while dropping the winter fuel allowance, some of these titles might well have given him hell for a three-pronged assault on their readers. David Cameron could only have dreamed of the support that Mrs May has had in recent weeks. And just as she had the most sycophantic coverage of any modern PM, so Corbyn was under attack like nobody before him. Not Ed Miliband, not even Neil Kinnock, got the relentless vitriol saved for Corbyn. For most of the past four decades, the Prime Minister who Rupert Murdoch wanted to see in No 10 has won. That is true this time, too. But losing a majority and becoming dependent on the DUP wasn't in the plan. Fleet Street played a crucial role in Britain leaving the European Union. Measures that Britain's most powerful proprietors and editors wanted, such as the dropping of Leveson Two and Section 40, were granted in the Tory manifesto. But for all their brutal partisanship in this election, the Prime Minister was humiliated. Sites such as The Canary, The Skwawkbox, and Another Angry Voice are making a huge impact and earning a massive following. We have tended to focus on the alt-right or anti-establishment right online, looking at websites like Breitbart, Westmonster and - in America - InfoWars. As Jim Waterson of Buzzfeed UK argued in this excellent report, sites on the alt-left now boast hundreds of thousands of addicted and often politically active readers. They break news stories, thrive on social media shares, and run emotionally charged, highly partisan material that is handy in a tight race when you need to get the vote out. That some of them - not necessarily the three I mention above - are adept at sharing fake news is no impediment to their influence. There is nothing new, of course, about the deployment of Facebook to spread a message, encourage donations, and bypass journalists. In 2008, Barack Obama harnessed Facebook superbly to raise vast sums of money and beat John McCain. I spoke to Sam Jeffers, co-founder of the Who Targets Me? Project. He repeated something he said to The Times over the weekend: That according to his sample (11,000 volunteers), the Tories' Facebook campaigning was focused on fewer seats. In the last 48 hours of the campaign, his volunteers saw Labour adverts in 464 constituencies, and Tory adverts in only 205. This is just one project, of course, but given the Tories had a bigger war chest, it is astonishing. \"What we've also seen is far more sharing of Labour's ads, so that even in the seats the Tories were really targeting in the north, the ads they were paying for were being drowned out in people's news feeds by a sea of red ads and articles that were shared 'organically' by friends and family. Those messages are going to have a lot more weight in people's minds.\" So you can spend loads on Facebook, as the Tories did (we don't yet know how much); but Labour may have had a bigger impact (possibly by spending less) because their adverts resonated emotionally. That really matters. In short, he told me, Labour's organically-shared, pro-Corbyn message drowned out the Tories' paid-for ads. After May 2015, in which the vast majority of journalists (myself included) found egg on our faces after relying too heavily on the polls, there was a consensus that polls should be treated with immense caution. Remember they are snapshots not forecasts, and so on. Then with Brexit, that same reliance came to the fore. And so too with President Trump's election in the US. It seems that using polls to generate news headlines is a habit journalists just can't kick. They provide the illusion of a definitive, measurable impression of how the different parties are doing, and they often inject election campaigns with a sense of narrative and drama that they would otherwise lack. Best of all, from the point of view of selling newspapers, they can come as a surprise. \"Shock poll finds...\" is a hardy perennial. Indeed, The Times reported that YouGov's shock analysis pointed to Tory losses - and they were vindicated. But, by and large, the polls have again been woefully wrong. In 2015, they under-stated Tory support. This time, they under-stated Labour support. And yet they were still often treated as gospel. A free media will always be free to make mistakes, but the excessive reliance of journalists on polls to create news stories comes at a terrible cost. It reduces space and resources for actually going out and talking to voters about their lives, and - adjoined to the viral energy of social media - it promotes precisely the kind of herd mentality and hollow consensus that any journalist worth his or her salt should instinctively despise.", "text": ["As", "many", "Tories", "have", "pointed", "out", ",", "their", "party", "increased", "its",

not benefiting from their region's immense copper and cobalt resources, so it was no surprise that many young people initially responded to the separatists' call. It is also an issue on which the southern province has infamous form. Less than a week after Congo's independence in June 1960, it announced it was seceding, sparking a conflict fuelled by Cold War rivalries. Secessionist leader and businessman Moise Tshombe was backed by Belgium, the ex-colonial power, and the UK and US, which all had mining interests in Katanga and baulked at the idea of a Congo led by a government allied to the Soviet Union. Within four months Congolese Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba had been overthrown. He was later assassinated, while Mr Tshombe eventually bowed to UN pressure and superior firepower. Katanga was reintegrated in 1963. Cold War politics may no longer be an issue for the Swahili-speaking province almost the size of France, but the alienation from the rest of DR Congo its many residents feel still is. However, the current separatists - the Mai Mai Kata Katanga movement - are not using tactics that will win the hearts and minds of the civilian population. \"They tied my mum to a tree and stuck an arrow through her rib cage,\" 18-year-old Antoinette told the BBC, recalling the secessionists' attack on her village of Montofita in which some houses were burnt and she and her mother were kidnapped. \"They cut off her breasts. I saw it all. Then each of the two men raped me. My neighbours were burned alive.\" Antoinette has found refuge in the small dusty town of Pweto on the border with Zambia where some 60,000 other Katanga villagers have gathered. The UN refugee agency estimates that more than 1,700 displaced women were raped before fleeing. In total nearly 400,000 people now live in camps for displaced persons - a huge number, often overshadowed by the even more numerous people forced from their homes by other conflicts in DR Congo. \"Maybe the population could have supported the Kata Katanga's cause, but they didn't give us a chance: they don't behave like a liberation movement. They burn villages and kill people,\" said Priscille, a Pweto resident. There are several groups of Mai Mai, the term for armed community groups, in Katanga. The Kata Katanga, which in Swahili means \"secede Katanga\", is the newest and was formed after Gedeon Kyungu Mutanga escaped from prison in September 2011. Before he was imprisoned in 2006, he had been head of a militia which fought alongside the Congolese forces against pro-Rwandan rebel groups in the 1990s. After the end of that conflict, he allegedly continued to receive discreet support from someone in the military. Following his escape, such links are thought to have continued - with top decisions and financing coming from a Katangan living abroad. A man who recently fled a rebel base with two wives and eight children told the BBC about the group's recruitment process. \"Gedeon came to our village in August 2012,\" he said. \"We did not see him with our eyes; he hid in a hut to talk to us. \"He told us that if we joined the Kata Katanga, we would have a better life. He told us that if Katanga became independent, it would put an end to the harassment by the soldiers, and would give us access to the resources that belong to us. \"Katanga is very rich, but we don't benefit at all. He told us that would change.\" The largest cobalt deposits in the world are in Katanga - and the province is the second biggest African provider of copper. While thousands of people walk for days on dusty roads to escape armed groups, other brand-new roads are used to transport millions of dollars' worth of minerals out of the country. Lorries full of cobalt and copper can be seen every day lining up for kilometres on end at the Zambian border. According to Congolese law, the government has to transfer 40% of the taxes paid by companies based in Katanga back to the province, but local human rights organisations say the tax money has had no visible impact. The skyline of Lubumbashi is dominated by its slag heap, but outside the provincial capital, schools, hospitals and asphalt roads - besides those heading to the border - are rare sights. Lucien, a school teacher from Kabisa now in Pweto, said a dozen men joined up with the separatists from his village. \"I was targeted by the armed groups because I am educated, I tell people the truth, and so I deterred young men from joining armed groups,\" he told the BBC. \"I told them it would bring them only misery.\" According to local authorities in Pweto, hundreds of Mai Mai fighters have deserted the movement since the beginning of the year, exhausted and demoralised. \"We will never achieve independence. We are poorer than before, many of us died,\" one former fighter said. Yet in March, more than 200 Kata Katanga fighters, lightly armed, covered with magic charms and waving flags of the independent State of Katanga, entered Lubumbashi. They raised their flag in the town's central square before surrendering to UN peacekeepers after a battle in which 23 people died. Since then, the Mai Mai has threatened to enter the city again. \"We are afraid, the last time they entered many people were killed by stray bullets. It's almost like a rebellion,\" one Lubumbashi resident said. The villagers who fled to Pweto said soldiers from the UN or Congolese army were nowhere to be seen when they came under attack. The UN refugee agency UNHCR has called on the UN peacekeeping mission, Monusco, to increase its presence in the region to protect civilians. Monusco did send an unspecified number of Egyptian special forces to Lubumbashi in June, to reinforce the 450-strong brigade already in Katanga. The UN says the situation in Katanga is \"very concerning\" but the province of North Kivu, where some 6,000 peacekeepers are stationed, remains the priority of the mission at the moment. It is not clear how many government soldiers are deployed in Katanga and the government says it has no intention of sending reinforcements. \"For me there is no rebellion,\" said Congolese Prime Minister Matata Ponyo, adding that people had a democratic space to express their views and the government would attempt to control such movements. The governor and local interior minister declined to comment on the situation. According to the UNHCR, government soldiers are responsible for a large portion of the cases of sexual violence registered among the displaced people. The UN World Food Programme (WFP) says it is struggling to assist even half of those displaced by the unrest as it does not have the funds. \"Katanga is still seen as a 'rich' province,\" explains Anne Nardini, head of the WFP programme in Lubumbashi. One resident of Lubumbashi summed up the general feeling of many people in Katanga. \"Independence could be a good thing for Katanga, but it depends primarily on how it is achieved,\" he said. \"If this is for the people, yes, but to serve the interests of a small group, no thank you.\"", "text": ["In", "Katanga", ",", "it", "is", "common", "to", "hear", "people", "complain", "that", "they",

He has won the last two races from pole position and, had things gone slightly differently in Mexico last weekend, Hamilton might have got the break he needed. A few centimetres either way and title rival Nico Rosberg's car might have been damaged in his collision with Red Bull's Max Verstappen at the first corner. Rosberg will be champion if he wins the next race in Brazil. But it could yet turn around for Hamilton. Rosberg is playing the calculated game, which is exactly the right thing to do. His job is to win the World Championship. And no-one in six months' time will remember or care whether he won it by finishing second in the last four grands prix. Hamilton has had the worst of the luck with reliability at Mercedes, but equally he has let himself down with a couple of shaky weekends and some bad starts. But you can point at problems Rosberg has had in free practice, or some of his weak races, such as Monaco. Ultimately, whoever is champion deserves it. And if you win a world title by beating Hamilton in the same car in races, then you have not done a bad job. When Hamilton is on his game, he has that little bit of an extra edge. But he is not always on his game, and that is what gives Rosberg hope. And you have to say that, after being given a kicking last year, Rosberg has left no stone unturned in his pursuit of this year's title. If Hamilton pulls this back from the position he is in, it will have been a masterful achievement. And Rosberg has to be careful at the next race in Brazil on 11-13 November. Knowing he can be champion that weekend if he wins will make it all the harder for him to follow his one-race-at-a-time approach. World championships are won and lost in the head. The closer the championship gets, the more nervy a driver becomes. Rosberg does not have to attack - he knows he can take the cautious approach. But I expect Red Bull to be pretty strong at Interlagos. Their Renault engine has improved a lot recently, and the car will be quick through the twisty middle sector. Equally, Brazil often throws up a chaotic race, not least because the weather is so changeable. It is the highest risk for Rosberg not to finish second or third, which he needs to do to stop Hamilton taking back control. A good example was 2012, when Sebastian Vettel was so nearly taken out in a first-lap collision, but survived and hung on to the championship by the skin of his teeth as his rival Fernando Alonso finished second but did not quite make up enough ground. The Mexican Grand Prix ended in something close to farce. In more than 30 years in motorsport, I have never seen such a crazy situation as three people finishing third in an F1 race. Verstappen crossed the line third but was demoted before he got to the podium. A frustrated Vettel went to the podium and therefore had to answer all the questions he did not want to be asked. And then he found out he, too, had been penalised and the guy who finished fifth, Verstappen's team-mate Daniel Ricciardo, was ultimately classified third. It was a strange race, in that a manic first lap and crazy finish - produced by the various tyre strategies of Verstappen, Vettel and Ricciardo - bookended what was in between a pretty dull grand prix. The series of controversial incidents during the race in Mexico City have led to a lot of discussion about Formula 1's rules and regulations in such circumstances. Many people - including Verstappen himself - have pointed out what they see as a contradiction between the fact that race-winner Hamilton did not receive a penalty for cutting across the grass at Turns One and Two on the first lap, and that Verstappen did for doing it later in the race. I have been an official driver steward at a number of grands prix. And the way the rules are operated - and all the drivers and teams know about this - there was no contradiction. Firstly, the start and first lap are treated differently from the rest of the race. That's not to say you can get away with anything - as was proved when Carlos Sainz was penalised for pushing Fernando Alonso on to the grass - dirty driving is still dirty driving and will be punished. But little incidents, details of driving, are tolerated that would not be during the main part of the race, simply because it's an inevitably more hectic environment with so many cars together at the same time. On the first lap, Hamilton locked a wheel and ran wide at Turn One. He cut across the grass and rejoined in Turn Two. There were several reasons why he was not given a penalty: it was the first lap, when there is more latitude; he was not fighting with anyone - he was clearly in the lead and the battle was for second behind him; and he lifted off as soon as he rejoined the track. That was quick and clear thinking from Hamilton and it was crucial because the stewards work on the basis of a rule that dictates a driver must not gain a \"lasting advantage\" by going off the track. The lock-up and flat spot meant Hamilton ended up in a risky situation - it means big vibrations that not only shake the driver around but also risk breaking the suspension. This famously happened to Kimi Raikkonen at the Nurburgring in 2005. He led much of the way, ran a long time on a tyre with a flat-spot on it, and the suspension shattered on the very last lap of the race. Verstappen fitted his medium tyres to take him to the end of the race on lap 12, whereas Vettel did not stop until lap 33 - so had tyres with 21 laps less wear on them. Coming up behind them was Ricciardo, who fitted new soft tyres on lap 51, with only 20 laps to go. On old medium tyres, it is easier to lose tyre temperature on long straights, which was almost certainly a contributing factor to Verstappen locking up at the start of lap 68. He went off the track and across the grass within half a metre or so of the line Hamilton had been on at the start. Could he have got the car back on to the track? Almost certainly. But he would have lost at least one position to Vettel and probably another to Ricciardo as well. The problem was that going across the grass meant he gained and kept a lasting advantage as opposed to losing one. Hence the penalty. Verstappen's refusal to give the place to Vettel set up Ricciardo's attack on the German on the penultimate lap, as the Ferrari was being held back to the Dutchman's pace. Ricciardo got a good run on Vettel out of Turn Two and I was surprised that Vettel did not move to the inside earlier to cover and try to send him around the outside - especially as he said afterwards he knows Ricciardo will often have an \"optimistic\" attempt, without question or hesitancy. That gave Ricciardo a chance to have a go down the inside and he went for it at the exact moment they were coming into the braking area. Vettel started to close the space in the braking area. This is something that has been discussed at a lot of drivers' briefings this season, predominantly in the context of Verstappen's driving. A new clarification was brought out at the US Grand Prix, the week before Mexico, spelling out what was acceptable in this area. The FIA said drivers' could not make any change in direction in the braking area that led to another driver having to take evasive action. Why is this area so sensitive? Think back to the Australian Grand Prix at the start of the season. There, owing to a misunderstanding in the braking area, Fernando Alonso's McLaren was launched over Esteban Gutierrez's Haas into an almighty accident. Those are the risks of moving in the braking area. So it was hardly surprising that the move was investigated and Vettel ended up being penalised. The stewards did well to give Verstappen his penalty early enough before the podium ceremony; it was just a shame they could not manage that in time to get Ricciardo up on to the podium. Vettel has escaped sanction for the expletive-laden tirade he launched over the radio in the race. But he has to bear in mind that he now has six penalty points on his licence - and if any driver gets 12 in any 12-month period, that is an automatic one-race ban. The Vettel we are seeing now - both in and out of the car - is not the same man who won four consecutive world titles with Red Bull, or even who won three races for Ferrari last year. Ferrari came into this season expecting to challenge Mercedes, but it has been a disappointing year, with questionable strategy and technical errors. It looked for a while as if Vettel might win the opening race of the season in Australia, only for the team to make a bad strategic call when the race was stopped for Alonso's accident. Another potential victory went begging in Canada for similar reasons. They have been leapfrogged by Red Bull - Vettel's former team - and only at seven of the 19 races so far this year has Ferrari's gap to pole position been closer than it was in 2015. It has become a very frustrating season and there is no question there is a lot of pressure on that team. Emotions are running high, and you can hear it in Vettel's radio messages, about slower drivers, blue flags, people blocking him - all expressed in the manner of someone who is very frustrated. Yes, they are being broadcast. But they are being broadcast because he is making them. If he didn't, they couldn't broadcast them. His comments about FIA F1 director Charlie Whiting - even though they were rooted in the fact that he felt no action was being taken about Verstappen, whose driving Vettel has been unhappy with on a number of occasions this year - are the ones that really caused an uproar. When you're in the car, the emotions run high. Your brain is processing things at 200mph and all the energy and adrenalin means these things can bubble out. I've done it as well. I remember in one race I was complaining about something and my engineer came back and said: \"Allan, keep calm.\" The exact words Ferrari team boss Maurizio Arrivabene said to Vettel on Sunday. And I replied: \" I am calm!\" Clearly, I wasn't. The bizarre thing about it all is that Vettel was voted driver of the day by the fans, and I suspect it was at least as much to do with his outpouring of emotion as it was for his driving. So, fine, warn Vettel about certain aspects of his behaviour. But the fans connect to the emotions and action involved, and F1 needs to be aware of that.

that it will \"take a while before we are a decent match\". But Vettel is kidding no-one, least of all Mercedes. Ferrari have been a serious threat at each of the last three races, beating them at one. They have finished on the podium at all four grands prix so far this season, and Vettel's team-mate Kimi Raikkonen split the Mercedes drivers in the last race in Bahrain. \"We didn't see it in pre-season testing or at the first race,\" says Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff. \"But since then every race has been a step forward from Ferrari. Their rate of development has been very impressive over the winter and the last three races. That is quite a challenge for us.\" It is a remarkable turnaround, coming as it does after 2014, when the Italian team had their worst season in 21 years, scoring only two podiums. And while Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton has a relatively comfortable 27-point advantage at the head of the championship after an almost perfect start to the season, Vettel is just one point behind the Englishman's team-mate Nico Rosberg. So how have Ferrari gone from also-rans to title contenders in the space of a few months? Last year, Ferrari's performance was so bad that Fernando Alonso finally ran out of patience after five years of battling against the odds and decided that, to get a title-winning car in the relatively near future, he had to go elsewhere, even if it meant taking a temporary step backwards. In hindsight, Alonso's decision was clearly a mistake. But it's not hard to see where the Spaniard, now at struggling McLaren-Honda, was coming from. Alonso came agonisingly close to winning the title with Ferrari in both 2010 and 2012, despite an inferior car to eventual champion Vettel's Red Bull. He won at least one race in each of his first four seasons at Maranello and finished second in the championship three times in his first four years. In 2014, Alonso managed just two podium finishes - a third place in China and a second in the wet/dry race in Hungary. He finished sixth in the championship. Through that season, Ferrari's average lap-time deficit to the fastest Mercedes car in qualifying was 1.22 seconds. The power-unit - which was about 50bhp off the Mercedes and had an under-effective and inefficient hybrid system that was a particular handicap in races - accounted for about two-thirds of that, with the remaining 0.4secs due to the chassis, which is predominantly to do with aerodynamics. This year, Ferrari's average qualifying deficit to the fastest Mercedes is 0.705secs, but in the races it is nowhere near that. Indeed, it has been as good as negligible in two of the four races this year. Much of the progress is down to the engine - Ferrari have added 65bhp to their V6 turbo hybrid already, with more to come. Mercedes - despite suggestions last year of an extra 50bhp for 2015 - have found more like only 15-20bhp at best. Judging by the speed-trap figures, Mercedes probably retain a small power advantage. But only very small. To all intents and purposes, then, any difference in lap time between the Ferrari and the Mercedes is probably down to the chassis, the driver and the difference in the two cars' behaviour on the tyres. They are close enough that, if Ferrari get everything right, Mercedes are beatable. Tyres are a key factor here. The Ferrari is more gentle on its tyres, a characteristic it has retained for many years. This gives it an advantage in races, in that it can run for longer at closer to its maximum potential. But it is a disadvantage in qualifying, as it is harder to get the tyres up to full working temperature before the start of a lap. That means the Ferraris, for now, are qualifying behind at least one of the Mercedes. Which makes their races more difficult because, with delicate tyres making it hard to follow another car closely, track position is a critical advantage. Analysing the two teams' comparative performance in qualifying last year and this is not quite a like-for-like comparison. Last year, Rosberg out-qualified Hamilton 11 times to seven, so more often than not the fastest Mercedes was the German's. This year, Hamilton has upped his game and has scored four poles out of four. And Ferrari's average qualifying deficit to Rosberg is only 0.214secs. Taking the Briton out of the race results also makes interesting reading. Rosberg has two second and two third places so far this season, which is an average position of 2.5. But the average of the best result of the Ferrari drivers at each race is slightly better, at 2.25. Which suggests that a fair chunk of Mercedes' overall advantage so far this year is in Hamilton himself. Another factor is that Alonso - who out-qualified Raikkonen by more than 0.5secs on average and 16-3 overall - is no longer in the Ferrari. Vettel's advantage over the Finn is just over half that so far. Where Alonso would be qualifying and racing this year's Ferrari can only be a matter of speculation. Ferrari have undergone a major restructuring in the course of the last 18 months - including some major blood-letting of senior engineering staff at the end of last season. Sacked were engine chief Luca Marmorini, engineering director Pat Fry, chief designer Nikolas Tombazis and tyre expert Hirohide Hamashima. They paid the price for five years of failure and decline, which culminated in a 2014 car that was compromised from the start. The chassis team asked the engine department for a number of features on the power-unit that would help them improve the car's aerodynamics. This meant compromising the engine's performance because of restrictions imposed on packaging. The aerodynamicists insisted this didn't matter, as they would make up the time loss and more in downforce. But they didn't. And given the much greater importance of the engine in the overall performance balance of the car in the new turbo hybrid formula, that was a major miscalculation. This year, those engine compromises have been largely removed - leading to a dramatic step forward in power. But the team have still managed to improve downforce as well. Some of the changes to the engine layout have actually improved aerodynamics, and had other positive knock-on effects. For example, they have allowed a more pronounced curve in the so-called 'coke-bottle shape' - or waisted bodywork - at the rear. This enhances rear downforce, the lack of which was a major failing in last year's car. That has allowed the team to run more front downforce and keep the car balanced, which was not possible last year. And that in turn gives a more positive turn-in to corners - which is exactly the characteristic both Vettel and Raikkonen need in a car to give their best. While the ultra-adaptable Alonso managed to drive around some of the car's problems last year, Raikkonen could not. With the new Ferrari's more benign behaviour, both the team's current drivers can access more of their own potential and therefore the car's as well. Technical director James Allison - who joined in September 2013, and had no input on the 2014 car at the conceptual stage and little on its design at all - says that \"in pure lap time, the gains are almost equal chassis to power unit\". But this is almost certainly a politician's answer. The Mercedes teams believe the Ferrari engine is now effectively their equal. So while the Ferrari chassis is clearly much closer to the absolute pace than in 2014, it remains the biggest contributor to Ferrari's much smaller overall deficit to Mercedes. Ferrari's chassis improvements have come about through Allison changing the focus of the design group. \"I haven't designed a single piece of this car,\" Allison says. \"There are a lot of very talented people who do that. \"If I have had any effect it is to try to say which bits are worth putting a lot of effort into, to try to make sure the pressure has been taken off people to deliver things for next week but to work with a slightly longer timescale in mind. \"It frees up your hand to do a good job. It is very hard to do anything in F1 on a two- to three-month timescale. You have to build up over months rather than weeks.\" The million-dollar question, then, is how long will it take for Ferrari to close the performance gap to Mercedes to nothing. Ferrari have what Allison calls \"a fairly exciting development programme and a lot of performance to bring\". On the engine, another 15bhp or so is due soon - most likely for the Canadian Grand Prix in early June. Ferrari also have more scope to improve their engine than Mercedes. Out of the permitted 32 development 'tokens' - ascribed to parts of the engine depending on their influence on performance - they have saved 10 to use during the season, while Mercedes have only seven, having applied more over the winter. \"We will be shunting performance on to car as quick as we can find it and make it,\" Allison says. \"There's a bag load in the pipeline in the factory at the moment and that will get onto the car as soon as we can and there will be more coming after that. \"The aero programme is performing strongly and these are still quite young aero rules, so I think we can expect more from it. Ditto the engine. And the whole situation with the tokens means it's a very different year this year compared with last year. Notwithstanding the gains we've made to date, we think we can bring a lot more during the year.\" But Mercedes are not exactly going to be standing still. They, too, have significant upgrades coming on both car and engine. \"We have solid foundations in the team,\" Wolff says. \"We have built an organisation that can be successful on a sustainable basis long term, with the challenge of Ferrari bouncing back very strongly.\" He is about to find out whether he is right.", "text": ["The", "German", "says", "there", "is", "``", "still", "a", "bit", "of",

Europe's elite for the best players. But as Angel Di Maria looks set to leave Old Trafford for French champions Paris St-Germain after a single year in the Premier League, BBC Sport looks at why the \u00a359.7m Argentina international has failed on the stage which seemed ready-made for his talents. It all seemed so perfect. In the summer of 2013 Manchester United had been looking for a marquee signing with which to usher in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. Cristiano Ronaldo could not be lured back from Real Madrid. Gareth Bale was chased but his heart was set on joining Ronaldo at the Bernabeu. Twelve months on, the need was more acute. Without the collective mental strength Ferguson so painstakingly forged, technical and physical deficiencies had been exposed during David Moyes' ill-fated tenure. Glamour was not required purely to make United fans feel good. It was a necessity if they were to compete with Chelsea, Manchester City and Liverpool, who had taken their Champions League place. Real, back in the 'Galactico' business of accumulating star names, had one man too many following the arrival of one of the 2014 World Cup's stand-out performers, Colombia's James Rodriguez. Di Maria, man of the match in the Champions League final three months earlier, was deemed surplus to requirements and United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward swooped. The Argentine signed a five-year contract on 26 August, 2014, for a British record fee of \u00a359.7m. Talk at the time suggested Di Maria would be paid in excess of \u00a3200,000 a week, with bonuses for winning the Premier League, Champions League and even the Ballon d'Or for the world's best player over the course of a five-year contract. His early performances suggested such optimism was justified. Di Maria scored a goal and claimed an assist in three of his first four games for United. The stand-out effort was a magical chip at Leicester on 21 September to put the visitors two goals up in a game they were eventually to lose 5-3. United fans were in thrall to their new number seven. Di Maria responded by saying moving to Old Trafford from Madrid represented a step up in his career. Working out why good things turn bad is a precarious business. The facts are that after the victory over Everton on 5 October, Di Maria did not score another goal until 4 January, when United beat League One Yeovil in the FA Cup third round. Did anything happen in between? Maybe not one seismic moment but a few events rolled up and made a big one seem all the more significant. In October, Argentina lost a friendly match 2-0 against Brazil in Beijing. Di Maria played the full 90 minutes. The air quality was not great, the temperature was high. Three days later, Di Maria featured for the final 17 minutes of a friendly against the Hong Kong national side. The round trip was approximately 12,000 miles. For a player who had not had much of a summer break because of his international commitments and had finished the World Cup with a thigh injury, the Far East trip must have been physically draining. In addition, United manager Louis van Gaal's search for his best formation - and Di Maria's best position in it - meant there was little consistency to his role. In the South American's first 16 United games, he played in six different positions, including central midfield and striker. As consistency continued to prove elusive, Di Maria's contribution seemed to be affected. As well as not scoring, he created only three goals in four months between 6 October, 2014 and 10 February, 2015. A pelvic injury kept him out for virtually all of December. So a combination of likely fatigue, injury, lack of form and getting used to a new country and obvious language difficulties could all have been playing on his mind on 31 January, when thieves attempted to break into Di Maria's mansion in Cheshire. Although the intruders did not gain entry, they did smash a glass door and the mental impact on Di Maria's wife, Jorgelina Cardoso, and their young daughter, was so great they are now living in a city-centre apartment, which, while luxurious, is hardly ideal for family life. On the pitch, Di Maria's slide continued. Sent off in the FA Cup quarter-final defeat by Arsenal on 9 March, Di Maria was a substitute in six successive games following his return from suspension. He did start the final match of the campaign against Hull, only to limp off with a hamstring injury after 23 minutes. This combination of circumstances led to Di Maria becoming extremely unhappy and wanting a move. As recently as Sunday, Van Gaal said he hoped the Argentine would stay. Yet the Dutchman has also stated at various times over the past year it is counterproductive trying to keep unhappy players. The difference between this situation and goalkeeper David De Gea's possible move to Real Madrid, for instance, is that while the Spaniard is a relaxed presence around the United camp, Di Maria has not joined up with the squad in the United States on their pre-season tour while his future is thrashed out. Paris St-Germain were keen on taking him last year and are now offering a get-out. For United, the bitterness of losing a player of such talent is eased by a transfer system which means, financially, they may not take the massive hit it first appears. Because of the strength of the pound and the change in exchange rates in the past 12 months, plus the way the initial transfer fee was structured, if PSG agree to pay the reported 65m euros (\u00a346.05m), United's overall loss would be less than \u00a310m. United fans have been here before. Juan Sebastian Veron arrived with enormous fanfare - and a then British record \u00a328.1m price tag - from Lazio in 2001 but lasted only two seasons before he left for Chelsea. Sir Alex Ferguson also broke the club transfer record when he paid Tottenham \u00a330.75m for Dimitar Berbatov in 2008. The Bulgarian did win the Golden Boot in 2010-11, but finished the campaign not able to get a place in United's Champions League final squad. Within six months he had left for Fulham. Yet possibly more than those two, Di Maria's eventual exit will leave a sad sense of 'what might have been' purely because his talent has been so obvious in the past and his departure so swift. \"I don't understand it,\" said Ryan Chelva, a fan from Australia who saw United beat Barcelona 3-1 in Santa Clara, California, without Di Maria at the weekend. \"If you sign someone as good as him, you have to give him more than a single season. \"He played really well in his first couple of months. He proved he can play under Louis van Gaal. He proved he has the talent. Now it looks as though he is leaving. It is hugely disappointing.\"", "text": ["His", "capture", "was", "supposed", "to", "be", "a", "show", "of", "power", "from", "Manchester", "United", "that", "they", "could", "still", "compete",

that refereeing standards are getting worse and people are quick to point out their mistakes but, when you have a week like this one where there are no obvious errors, nobody says how well they have done. The FA Cup third round is admittedly a little different to a Premier League weekend because some of the ties are less even and so less competitive. But out of 32 ties, the biggest talking points concerning refereeing decisions were the red card given to Chelsea's John Terry and the penalty awarded to Manchester City in their 5-0 win over West Ham. Terry appealed against his dismissal for a professional foul in Chelsea's 4-1 win over Peterborough, but I have no idea why. It was no surprise when the decision was upheld. City's penalty, when Pablo Zabaleta went down under a challenge from Angelo Ogbonna, was less clear-cut but, again, I can see why the referee gave it. This weekend was not the first time I have watched games while getting a referee's perspective - through my TV work, I have watched a lot of Premier League matches recently sitting next to former top-flight official Howard Webb. What I have learned from him is how quickly referees have to make a decision, and how certain things affect it. One of them is players crowding around the official. Webb felt it made a big difference earlier in the season when the rule was being enforced that you cannot surround the referee to protest against a decision, but he feels it has not been policed as much in recent weeks and it has crept back in. He was not sure why they have stopped warning players not to do it, because it makes it harder for referees when they have got a big call to make but they have got all kinds of people chatting away in their ear. Enforcing that crowding ruling again would be a relatively simple fix but there are other more revolutionary ways to help referees get things right more often. In-game video refereeing is probably the most talked about idea, and has already been trialled by governing body Fifa. For me, it is 100% the way forward and should be brought into the Premier League as soon as possible - it is just a matter of deciding how to implement it. You could have a video official who looks at incidents automatically, have a system where the referee requests which incidents are reviewed, or let managers get involved and give them one or two 'challenges' each half to use when they want to appeal against a decision or flag up something they think has been missed. A combination of all three might be the answer. I would hope that the video official and the referee could work together as a team and be in constant contact anyway, especially for big game-changing decisions - there should be no need for managers to request a review of those. The technology is already there to use video refereeing, and I think we are being a bit stubborn not using it. I know from my TV work that for all Premier League games, the number of cameras at grounds mean video analysts can offer replays of an incident from several different angles within a few seconds. At the moment, that footage is seen pitch-side in the press box as well as by us in the TV studio, but not by the referee or any of his team of officials. If you could offer that same facility to them then you are going to get more correct decisions. There are obviously plenty of incidents where replays are inconclusive, but at least this would give officials the chance to take a second look before making their minds up. Part of the criteria for deciding which system to implement should be the potential time it could add to the game and I think everyone would agree that part of it has to be right. I don't see it being a problem in football. Rugby League has embraced video refereeing, and it can be annoying when every try is reviewed, but overall it does not affect the flow of the game, or dramatically extend every game. If we are talking about five minutes being added on at the end of each match then that would work fine in the Premier League - the 30 extra minutes or so you get added on in the NFL would not. Going by what has happened in other sports like cricket and tennis, I don't think it would take long for everyone - referees, players, managers and fans - to get used to it. Crucially, I cannot think of a sport that has started using it and then stopped. We have already seen the benefits of football trusting in goal-line technology, for getting things right and also avoiding any argument about the decision afterwards - most of the time. The only time I have ever seen a debate about it was during Manchester City's win over Burnley at the start of January, when there was a decision to be made over the order of events - City keeper Claudio Bravo was fouled in a goalmouth scramble, but the goal had already been given. I cannot imagine referee Lee Mason had been in that situation before, where his watch buzzed to tell him the ball had crossed the line but he did not automatically give a goal because he had to think about what had gone on before it. Mason got that bit spot-on, but it did not appear he communicated his thought process to the managers via the fourth official. That is the only criticism I would make of that situation because it led to City boss Pep Guardiola boiling over during his interview to the BBC after the game, or at least that is what I assumed he was unhappy about. It annoyed me because that confusion could have been cleared up in five seconds if anyone had explained to Guardiola what had happened. Do that, and everyone looks good. The ideal time to get that kind of information across is through the fourth official during the game but, failing that, the communication should definitely happen afterwards. Before Christmas, Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger complained that referees were \"protected like lions in a zoo\" because it is not possible to question their decisions without getting into trouble. Wenger had just seen his side beaten by two Manchester City goals that he felt were offside and, just as with Guardiola against Burnley, it would have been easy to explain those decisions to him before he faced the media. The best way to do that would be to have a debrief after every game where the manager can get clarity on anything he wants from the referee. I don't agree that the referees should face the media, however. Let the managers talk to them and then they can decide whether to talk about it in the press conference afterwards. If they do pass on that information, then at least the decision-making process is clear even if the decision itself is wrong. From my own experience as a player, that would make things easier for everyone to accept.

regardless of nationality. This year's shortlist features two authors from the UK, two from the US and one each from Jamaica and Nigeria. Here is a brief guide to the six books. By Marlon James (Jamaica) Published by Oneworld About the book: Exploring the attempted assassination of Bob Marley in the late 1970s, events unfold over three decades through the lives of drug barons, MPs, gunmen, beauty queens, journalists and even the CIA. About the author: Born in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1970, James's debut novel was John Crow's Devil. His second, The Book of Night Women, won the 2010 Dayton Literary Peace Prize and was a finalist for the 2010 National Book Critics Circle Award. The judges said: \"The title misrepresents its heft and its body count. This vast fictional history which spirals out from the politics and gang violence of 1970s Jamaica is exhilarating in its range of voices and registers: swaggering, brutal, elegiac, sardonic, humorous, tender and profane. And what a story - it knocks your socks off.\" The reviews said: \"Seven Killings resembles James Ellroy's LA Quartet in its blistering violence, multiple voices and its determination to redo history 'from the gutter to the star', to borrow a phrase used by Ellroy.\" The Telegraph By Tom McCarthy (UK) Published by Jonathan Cape About the book: Set in contemporary London, Satin Island tells the story of U - a \"corporate anthropologist\" working for an elite consultancy who embarks on a data-gathering project to help \"decode and manipulate the world around them\". About the author: McCarthy was born in 1969 and grew up in London. His books include Remainder (2006), Men in Space (2007), and C (2010) - which was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize. In 1999, he created the International Necronautical Society (INS), a \"semi-fictitious organisation\" that combines literature, art and philosophy. The judges said: \"Satin Island offers an elegant, desperate and funny account of what might well be the world of tomorrow if it weren't already the world of today.\" The reviews said: \"It provokes and beguiles and, at the point of revelation, it withholds. On finishing it, you will have the powerful urge to throw it across the room, then the powerful urge to pick it up to read again.\" The Telegraph By Chigozie Obioma (Nigeria) Published by One About the book: Four young brothers in a small Nigerian town take advantage of their father's absence to go fishing at a forbidden river. But there they encounter a madman, who makes a prophecy that the eldest will be killed by one of his brothers. About the author: The Fishermen is Chigozie Obioma's first novel. Born in 1986 in Akure, Nigeria, Obioma's short stories have appeared in Virginia Quarterly Review and New Madrid. He has lived in Nigeria, Cyprus and Turkey, and now in the US. The judges said: \"Obioma's The Fishermen is the captivating tale of the tragic unravelling of a family in modern day Nigeria. He imbues the story with a compelling sense of deep-rooted and unstoppable inevitability, writing with striking maturity for a young first-time writer.\" The reviews said: \"The Fishermen is an elegy to lost promise, to a golden age squandered, and yet it remains hopeful about the redemptive possibilities of a new generation - what I like to call the 'post-nationalist generation', described as 'egrets' in the book: harbingers of a bright future.\" The Guardian By Sunjeev Sahota (UK) Published by Picador About the book: A group of immigrant Indian labourers share a dilapidated house in Sheffield in search of a new life. About the author: Sahota was one of is a Granta's Best of British Novelist 2013. Born in 1981 in Derbyshire, his debut novel was Ours are the Streets, published in 2011. The judges said: \"As much sorrow and damage as there is in these lives, no-one here is asking for pity. These characters are genuine seekers on the lookout for second chances in a world which seems at times to offer not even one chance.\" The reviews said: \"This novel captures the growing realisation for new arrivals in Britain that life here can be just as hard - if not harder - than the one they left behind.\" The Independent By Anne Tyler (US) Published by Chatto & Windus About the book: A saga that unfolds through three generations of middle-class Baltimore family the Whitshanks. About the author: This is Tyler's 20th novel. Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1941, her first book, If Morning Ever Comes, was published in 1964. She won the Pulitzer prize for Breathing Lessons (1988). Her novel The Accidental Tourist (1985) was adapted into a film starring William Hurt, Kathleen Turner, and Geena Davis. A Spool of Blue Thread was also nominated for this year's Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction. The judges said: \"She demonstrates once again her supreme powers of observation, and the stylistic brilliance that have marked her work through 50 extraordinary years.\" The reviews said: \"Tyler never mocks her characters. Even when she's having fun with their weird peculiarities and transparent short-sightedness, she's usually a benevolent goddess. And yet it's her surprising brutality that kills off any germs of sentimentality in her work.\" Washington Post By Hanya Yanagihara (US) Published by Picador About the book: The story of four college friends who have moved to New York seeking fame and fortune. At the centre of the tale is the enigmatic Jude, an orphan with a painful past. About the author: Born in Los Angeles in 1975, Yanagihara is the author of The People in the Trees, which was shortlisted for the PEN/Robert W Bingham Prize for debut fiction. She is an editor-at-large at Conde Nast Traveller and lives in New York. The judges said: \"A Little Life is a work of lasting emotional impact, often larger than life itself, as Yanagihara delicately balances the horrors of a traumatic childhood with the story of selfless enduring tenderness and devotion.\" The reviews said: \"Somehow, against all the odds, just like its protagonist, this book survives everything its author throws at it - and if it doesn't quite triumph, it has far outplayed the odds.\" The Guardian", "text": ["It", "is", "the", "second", "year", "that", "the", "prize", "is", "open", "to", "all", "authors", "writing", "in", "English", ",",

professional lives. Many of them had directly experienced conflict. Every girl designed and directed her own photo shoot, posing as her future self\u00e2\u20ac\u0160. Whenever possible, they were shot in actual working environments, so they could meet people in their envisioned field and truly step into their future. This week's Supporting Syria and the Region conference in London aims to address some of the issues facing these children and others. International Development Secretary Justine Greening said: \"These photographs show the children who will one day rebuild Syria. The UK is urging the world to make a choice in education to ensure that the conflict does not rob Syria's children of a future. By giving them an education, they have the opportunity to become the doctors, lawyers and architects of tomorrow.\" \"Ever since we studied the solar system in primary school, I have wanted to be an astronaut. I would imagine myself up in the sky, discovering new things. \"I love being an astronaut because it lets me see the world from a new angle. In this society, my path was not easy - many people told me a girl can't become an astronaut. \"Now that I have achieved my goals, I would tell young girls with aspirations to not be afraid, to talk to their parents about what they want and why, to always be confident and know where you want to go.\" \"In this image, I am examining an X-ray of a patient to see what is causing the pain in her chest. \"At this point in my life, I am a well-respected surgeon in the region. I treat many patients, but the patient I care most about - the one that drove me to be a doctor- is my father, who has lots of medical issues. To be able to help my father, this makes me feel strong, powerful and capable.\" \"Since I was a young girl, I loved taking people's photographs. I loved going to different events and documenting what was happening - both the good and bad. Now, as a professional photographer, I use my images to inspire hope in others - to encourage love and understanding.\" \"I've always wanted to be a policewoman because the police not only keep people safe, but they also create justice in society. \"Every day I wake up, go to the station, and then head out into the city to see where I can help. I also work to inspire other young girls to become policewomen - supporting them to dream about their future and thinking about how they will overcome obstacles.\" \"I've always wanted to be an architect. Yet when I was young, people told me that this is not something a woman could achieve, and they encouraged me to pursue a more 'feminine' profession. \"But I dreamt constantly of making beautiful homes for families, and designing buildings that bring people joy. Now that I've reached my vision, I hope I am a model for other girls - showing them that you should never give up on your dream - no matter what others say.\" \"Our neighbour in Syria had a pharmacy, and when I was younger I would go next door and help. As the war started, I watched this pharmacist help the injured. When I saw this, I knew that this was an important job and what I wanted to do. \"Now that I am a pharmacist, I see myself as a role model for girls and a leader changing the world.\" \"Walking down the street as a young girl in Syria or Jordan, I encountered many people suffering - sick or injured - and I always wanted to have the power and skills to help them. \"Now, as a great physician in my community, I have that ability. Easing someone's pain in the most rewarding aspect of my job. To be able to give them relief is the most rewarding aspect of my job. To be able to give them relief and make them smile - this is what I love most.\" \"I want violence against women to end. I want women to be able to make decisions for the community, and say their opinion without fear. I want our society to open up and give space for women to be whoever they want to be. This is why I decided to become a lawyer. \"When I was younger, my mother told me I was courageous and truthful, and that I could be a great lawyer who fought injustice. I took her advice, and now am a respected lawyer working on women's rights and defending women who are victims of domestic violence.\" \"In the future, I am a famous fashion designer - creating chic clothing for women that makes them feel elegant. I design normal daywear that combines rough and soft fabrics, as well as formalwear and wedding dresses.\" \"I saw a policewoman for the first time when I was 11 - before that I hadn't considered it as a career. At that moment of my life, I wasn't even going to school - I just had no interest. But once I decided this was my dream, I studied hard and pursued it. \"Now that I am a policewoman, I help many people who are in danger or trouble, and I encourage young girls to get their education so that they can reach their goals.\" \"In this image, I am a popular painter, working on a landscape in oils. When I was younger, painting was a hobby - but as I grew older, I saw I had a great talent and went to art school. \"Now, I have my own gallery where I sell my paintings and sculptures. My hope is that my artwork inspires peace in the world and encourages people to be kind to one another.\" \"I love planes. Even before I had ever been on a plane, I knew I wanted to be a pilot. Flying is adventurous and exciting. \"When I was younger, my brother always told me that a girl can't be a pilot, but I knew deep down this is what I wanted to do. \"I finished my studies and found a way to get to flight school. Now, not only do I get to live my dream, but I also get to go to help people travel, to see the world, and discover new places.\" \"I have always found great pleasure in cooking. When I was young, I spent a lot of time in the kitchen with my mother - learning how to create different dishes. I was really good at it. \"Now as a chef, I have my own restaurant where I create the menu, and a shop where I make and serve different dairy products like milk, cheeses, and yoghurt.\" \"In this image, it is the early morning and I am waiting in my classroom for my students to arrive. I teach younger children to read and write Arabic. I am a very compassionate and kind person, and so a perfect teacher. I am strict, but I go out of my way to gently help those students who are having difficulties.\" \"I have always wanted to help children, and this is what drove me to be a paediatrician. I am kind and loving, and therefore an excellent doctor that children can trust.\" The UK, Germany, Kuwait, Norway, and the United Nations will co-host the Supporting Syria and the Region conference

of badgers shot by trained marksmen in two pilot zones in the South West this autumn. But the plan has been beset by problems. Surveys found more badgers that expected in the two areas, increasing the cost of the cull and making it more difficult to complete before badgers go underground for the winter. Wildlife campaigners launched a last minute legal challenge, while an e-petition signed by more than 150,000 people spurred a parliamentary debate set for Thursday. The proposals are designed to tackle the problem of TB in cattle, which cost more than \u00a390m last year and led to 26,000 cattle being slaughtered. A: Bovine tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease of cattle. It presents a serious problem for the cattle industry, causing financial and personal hardship for farmers. The disease is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis), which can also infect and cause TB in badgers, deer and other mammals. A: The clinical signs of bovine TB include weakness, coughing and loss of weight. However, these symptoms are seldom seen on farms as cattle are regularly tested for TB and then destroyed if they test positive. A: Scientific evidence has shown that bovine TB can be transmitted from cattle to cattle; from badgers to cattle and cattle to badgers; and from badger to badger. Badgers are thought to pass on the disease to cattle through their urine, faeces or through droplet infection, in the farmyard or in cattle pastures. However, it is not clear how big a role badgers play in the spread of bovine TB since the cows can also pass the disease on to other members of the herd. A: The most extensive scientific evidence comes from a \u00a350m study in England on whether culling badgers reduces bovine TB, known as the randomised badger culling trial or the Krebs trial. The data suggests that if certain conditions are met, culling could reduce disease incidence by an average of 16% over nine years, although it could be higher or lower. This figure takes into account both decreases in the number of new cases of TB within the cull zone, and an increase in cases outside - the so-called perturbation effect. The badger culling trial in England found that killing badgers disrupted their social groups, with badgers moving further afield to establish new groups, taking TB with them. This perturbation effect led to an increase in cases of bovine TB outside of the cull zone, although the impact diminished over time. The pilot culls are attempting to use borders such as rivers and motorways to reduce the risk of badgers spreading TB to neighbouring areas, but this approach has not been fully tested. Also, the Krebs trial trapped badgers in cages for the cull, while the main method planned for Gloucestershire and Somerset is free shooting. Any deviation from methods used in the original trial will decrease or increase the expected impact on bovine TB, say scientists. As independent scientists have pointed out, \"badger culling has positive and negative effects on bovine TB in cattle and is difficult, costly and controversial\" . Trained marksmen will shoot the badgers at night after putting food such as peanuts outside their setts. This method has not been formally tested before. In Ireland, badgers are caught with a snare, before being shot. The badger culling trial in England trapped badgers in cages before shooting them. According to one newspaper report, cage-trapping badgers for vaccination (or shooting) costs about \u00a32,500 per hectare, whereas shooting them as they run freely costs about \u00a3200. Q: How will the success of the pilot culls be measured? The pilot culls will look at whether badgers can be killed effectively and humanely, not at any scientific data. A government agency will carry out some sample post mortems to see if the badgers have been shot humanely. The carcasses will not be tested for signs of TB infection. On the basis of this evidence, ministers will make a decision about whether or not to extend the pilots. TB has cost the taxpayer in England \u00a3500m to control the disease in the last 10 years. According to the UK Government Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), each pilot cull will cost about \u00a3100,000 a year, with the costs met by farmers who want badgers to be killed on their land. Policing costs have been estimated at \u00a30.5m per area per year, according to a written answer to parliament. Scotland is classified as free of TB. The Welsh Assembly Government has chosen to vaccinate badgers, with trials underway in north Pembrokeshire. Northern Ireland is conducting research into an eradication programme involving vaccination and selected culling of badgers with signs of TB infection. The Republic of Ireland has been culling badgers since the 1980s. One study, known as the Four Areas Trial, found reductions in cattle TB incidence ranging from 51% to 68% over a five-year culling period. Culling is still underway, so there is no data that can be compared with the study in England. TB is not confined to the UK. Transmission between other wildlife species has been documented in Michigan, US, with white-tailed deer and cattle. In New Zealand the brush tail possum is thought to harbour bovine TB, and is killed using poison and traps. Other measures to reduce transmission include improved bio-security, particularly stopping badgers from getting into farm buildings where they can come into contact with cattle, or feed stores. According to a recent review of scientific evidence: \"Recent Defra data indicates that the average cost to farmers to improve bio-security is about \u00a34,000. Considering the average cost of dealing with a TB herd breakdown in GB (about \u00a327,000), these measures would appear to be a cost-effective way of attempting to reduce potential TB transmission between species.\" There is a vaccine for badgers - the BCG jab, which has been used by a number of wildlife and conservation bodies in England, including the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust, the RSPB, the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust and the National Trust. Badger vaccination is also underway in Wales, and there are plans to introduce it in Northern Ireland. According to the Food, Environment and Research Agency (Fera): \"Vaccinating badgers is a risk reduction measure. It reduces the risk of badgers catching TB, resulting in fewer infected badgers. This in turn may reduce the risk of transmission from badgers to cattle.\" Cattle can also be vaccinated with the BCG vaccine. However, vaccination of cattle against TB is currently prohibited by EU legislation, mainly because BCG vaccination of cattle can interfere with the tuberculin skin test, the main diagnostic test for TB. Vaccination is not effective in badgers or cattle that are infected with TB.", "text": ["The", "proposals", "would", "have", "seen", "thousands", "of", "badgers", "shot", "by", "trained", "marksmen",

waters and the Martian-orange and red cliffs surrounding them. The lakes, in Bamiyan province, are Afghanistan's first-ever national park, and draw thousands of local visitors every year. The government hopes foreign tourists will one day come too. If that sounds quixotic now, so too may the UN and the government's launch here of the country's first-ever environmental protection plan - with a solar-powered kettle one of its signature initiatives. But for those living in Bamiyan's isolated mountain valleys, the most immediate threat is not the Taliban but drought, partly induced by human activity. Climate change is making things worse and the lakes could be at risk too. Glaciers in the province's Koh-e Baba mountains, the western end of the Hindu Kush, recede further each year. The climate adaptation programme, as it's known, \"is not luxury, it's life\", says Bamiyan Governor Habiba Sarabi after climbing up to Qazan, one of 18 mountain farming communities involved in the $6m (\u00a33.75m) scheme. Some 3,000m (9,800ft) above sea level, this is always going to be a tough place to live and farm. But it's got tougher as trees and vegetation have been cut down for fuel - creating the beginnings of a high-altitude dust bowl. In an Afghan version of the Grapes of Wrath, more families are being forced to leave every year. Like shaved heads, most of the hillsides are bare, with just the occasional stubble of green. It also means villages are more exposed to \"flash-flooding in spring and summer and avalanches in winter\", says Andrew Scanlon of the UN Environment Programme. But he is now overseeing the planting of new trees and turf along Qazan's valley. Against the repetitive clanging of hammer on metal, workers in Bamiyan city are building scores of cleaner, more-efficient stoves. Run by an Afghan NGO called the Conservation Organisation for the Afghan Mountains (COAM), the workshop sells them on preferential terms to local villages and it already has more orders than it can fulfil. Mr Scanlon wants to expand the scheme elsewhere. COAM is promoting another energy-saving device, the solar kettle. It is basically a large satellite dish which reflects sun-rays onto a kettle suspended in the middle. The bigger the dish the quicker the boil - but the one they are selling for about $100 can make a cup of tea in 20 minutes. Yet with Nato forces retreating over the next two years, taking large chunks of aid money with them, there are concerns whether this tentative momentum can be maintained. The New Zealand run civilian-military provincial reconstruction team (PRT) in Bamiyan is due to close early next year. There are questions, too, over the future of Bamiyan's best-known landmark - the remains of the larger of its two rock Buddhas, blown up by the Taliban months before the US-led invasion in 2001. The vast cave, or niche, carved into the mountainside 1,500 years ago looms over Bamiyan like a ghostly sentinel - and a permanent reminder of what happened. But the niche is in \"imminent danger of collapse\", says Brendan Cassar of Unesco - the UN's cultural agency - and they need funding to shore it up. Security concerns are pressing in too - from districts around Bamiyan where the Taliban and other armed groups have become more active. Should the Buddhas be rebuilt? In pictures: Buddhas of Bamiyan That has had a knock-on effect on the small indigenous tourist trade here. If foreign tourists are still a fledgling species here, Band-e Amir national park usually attracts a steady flow of Afghan visitors. But there's been a sharp fall in numbers this year, as the threat along the road towards Bamiyan has risen. The park itself is still a long way from being managed like protected reserves elsewhere in the world. A guard with a piece of rope across the road is the gate-post. There is little control on villagers who live next to the lakes. They have often used grenades and other explosives for fishing. Rubbish sometimes gets dumped in the waters. But it is important to keep locals involved, \"so they benefit\", says Mostapha Zaher, the energetic head of Afghanistan's environmental protection agency - and grandson of the former king. He admits he's been called \"unrealistic\" for his dreams of developing national parks while the country is still in conflict. But Mr Zaher insists it will happen, with plans underway for a second park in the Wakhan corridor - the finger of mountainous territory that takes Afghanistan all the way to China. The UN deputy envoy Michael Keating, who has championed the environmental programmes, echoes his optimism: \"Twenty years ago who would have thought Cambodia could become a tourist destination?\" To Afghans, the lakes are sacred waters and they believe have healing properties. Perhaps one day, they will help heal Afghanistan too.", "text": ["Outsiders", "lucky", "enough", "to", "see", "them", "today", "are", "often", "lost", "for", "words", "when", "they", "first", "set",

Half of nurses said wards are dangerously understaffed, he told BBC Breakfast. The Conservatives say they inherited a nursing crisis from Labour, with staff shortages contributing to the Stafford hospital scandal between 2005 and 2008. \"We have turned that round with record high nurse numbers on our wards and a new focus on compassionate care\", a spokesman said. The Tories have already pledged an extra \u00a38bn a year by 2020 for the NHS in England if they win the election. But Mr Miliband said the Conservatives didn't \"know where a penny of it\" was coming from. Of the \u00a32.5bn promised by Labour, he said this was a \"downpayment\" and it was clear where the money was coming from. \"We are going to have a Budget within the first month of a Labour government,\" he added. \"It's going to put in place the mansion tax, the tobacco levy and the clampdown on tax avoidance by the hedge funds to get the money flowing into our NHS straightaway.\" Mr Miliband was speaking to BBC Breakfast ahead of a speech on Tuesday to student nurses at Manchester Metropolitan University. There, he will say that, if elected, he will ask universities to reopen admissions for highly-oversubscribed nursing courses. About 30,000 would-be nurses were turned away in 2014 because of the lack of places, he will tell the audience. He will also highlight new figures to emerge through Freedom of Information (FOI) requests which suggest one-third of NHS Trusts were investigated last year over concerns about safe staffing. Mr Miliband will say this disclosure follows reports in the last week showing the number of people waiting over four hours at accident and emergency departments has risen by over 50% compared to last year. \"Two-thirds of nurses say patients are missing out on care because there just aren't enough nurses on the wards,\" he will claim. \"None of this has happened by accident. \"It has happened as a direct result of choices this government has made; cutting nurse training, failing to understand that if people don't get the care they need at home and in their own communities, it ends up in an A&E crisis...\" \u2022 Conservatives: Increase NHS spending in England by at least \u00a38bn above inflation over the next five years \u2022 Labour: Extra \u00a32.5bn funding for the NHS, to pay for 20,000 more nurses, 3,000 midwives and 8,000 GPs \u2022 Lib Dems: Increase real terms NHS funding by at least \u00a38bn a year by 2020, starting with an extra \u00a31bn a year until 2018 \u2022 UKIP: Extra \u00a33bn a year for the NHS by 2020, used to fund 20,000 more nurses, 8,000 GPs and 3,000 midwives \u2022 Green: Increase NHS budget by \u00a312bn a year Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said there was a \"severe shortage\" of staff in the NHS, exacerbated by what he said was a \"stranglehold\" over recruitment by private agencies. \"We have got to get this agency bill down,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"It is literally going through the roof.\" Other aims of Labour's \"rescue plan\" include early planning to avoid a winter crisis in hospitals, and tackling what it describes as \"the \u00a3300m scandal of vulnerable people being kept in hospital this year because they cannot get the care they need to be discharged\". This issue includes NHS funding, GP access and social care, particularly of older people. Policy guide: Where the parties stand Q&A: Health and care - the background issues The NHS has become a major battleground for the main political parties, with more announcements on the service expected over the coming days. Labour says it wants to pay for extra nurses through its \"Time to Care Fund\", which will use money from a mansion tax of properties worth over \u00a32m, and also by cracking down on tax avoidance, and imposing levies on tobacco firms. Mr Miliband will say that this will bring in \u00a32.5 billion a year from 2016-17. The \u00a38bn-a-year figure pledged by the Conservatives for the NHS in England by 2020 if they win the election is one which NHS England boss Simon Stevens cited as the funding gap between what the NHS currently receives and what it needs to implement his modernisation programme. Pressed about the \u00a38bn figure, Mr Burnham said Labour would do \"whatever it takes\" to secure the future of the health service but was \"not going to give the NHS cheques that are going to bounce in a few years time\". A Conservative spokesman said: \"This government inherited a nursing crisis with the scandal of short-staffed wards at Mid Staffs and other failing hospitals. \"Unlike Ed Miliband, we have committed the additional \u00a38bn a year the NHS says it needs, which is the only way to ensure hospitals have the money they need to increase staff.\" The Lib Dems have also pledged \u00a38bn for the NHS funded by scrapping some tax reliefs. \"NHS staff and patients want to know the health service is secure for the long term,\" a party spokesman said. \"Until Labour agree to make the necessary resources available, all they can offer is warm words and nothing more.\" Subscribe to the BBC Election 2015 newsletter to get a round-up of the day's campaign news sent to your inbox every weekday

to some in the industry, \"you can walk onto a building site and see more diversity than in the average theatre\". Paapa Essiedu, who is currently the Royal Shakespeare Company's Hamlet, says theatre is \"caught between two worlds at the moment\". \"There's a lot of positivity about how we see our present and future and that's all good, but I still don't see or feel that impact. \"What is required is for people to be more bold and more adventurous in what they back.\" In Manchester, the Royal Exchange's King Lear saw veteran actor Don Warrington take the lead, something which he says \"should not be in any way startling\". Yet many reviews drew attention to his race, which Warrington says is \"an indictment of where we are\". He says while conditions have improved since he began his acting career almost 50 years ago, that anyone wants to discuss his casting shows there is still a \"problem\". \"There's a higher visibility, but the question is about the quality of that visibility and the quality of the parts. \"I don't think that is where it should be.\" Hamida Ali, the acting union Equity's equalities and diversity organiser, shares Warrington's unease. \"One of the things we remain concerned about is how surprised we might be when we see a black actor in a lead role, not just in Shakespeare, but in general. \"It says something in itself that that remains something of note.\" She says there is definitely \"a consensus that there is a problem, but what the cause is, who is responsible and what the solutions are is perhaps more in debate\". The production of Lear was put on with Talawa, a theatre company set in the 1980s \"in direct response to the lack of creative opportunities for actors from minority ethnic backgrounds\". Artistic director Michael Buffong says three decades on, there is still \"a rapid need for change\". \"What we need is different people to reflect different aspects of the same world, otherwise we have this very narrow viewpoint.\" Essiedu agrees theatre needs to be \"more diverse about the stories we're telling and the people that are telling them\". \"By doing that, there will be more opportunity for a more diverse group of actors. \"We're in 2016 in an international, multicultural, integrated society and we've got a responsibility as artists to reflect that in the work that we create.\" Matthew Xia, an associate artistic director at the Royal Exchange, says far from getting better, theatre has \"gone backwards in so many ways\". \"It's not just about the art, it's also about the organisational structure. \"In the majority of organisations, the moment you get to the leadership, it drops right down with regards to proportionate representation of the cities that they are working in. \"It's beyond me, because you can walk onto a building site and see more diversity than you can see in what is meant to be the liberal end of the work spectrum.\" Buffong says, as a result, there is a need to \"change the gatekeepers, because that's where the power is\". \"You can cast two black actors in a play and go 'wow, we've got two black actors' but that's not really the same as having a story from a particular point of view. \"Just because there is a black actor on the stage doesn't necessarily mean it's your story.\" Dawn Walton, the founder of Sheffield's Eclipse - which uses \"the Black British experience to create new work that will enrich the canon of British theatre\" - agrees. \"There is a belief in theatre that what is on stage is what needs to be diverse, so cross-casting is always where people go - casting a black whatever - but if that solved it, we'd have beaten this in the 1970s. She says theatre boards need to change because \"they're very much into doing the same thing over and over again... but the country has shifted\". \"The institution is becoming less and less relevant because it doesn't represent what goes on right outside its doors.\" Xia says theatre is \"still at a place where actors of colour are expected to play peripheral characters unless the play is explicitly dealing with race, which is ridiculous\". \"The human experience is so much broader than that. \"I've heard quite scary things said by directors which shows a lack of understanding about roles and who can play what. \"Ultimately, people are always going to represent their world on stage, so if their world has been monocultural, it's highly likely that's how the work will be rendered.\" The \"diversity of theatre generally is an issue\", according to Arts Council England's director of theatre, Neil Darlison. \"I think theatres are aware of it and if they're not, they should be, because ultimately it's going to affect their business.\" However, he says there are some positive signs, \"particularly in metropolitan centres, where the diversity of people working in organisations and running them is better than it was\". \"They're starting to reflect the stories of the inhabitants of the city.\" Warrington believes direct action is needed to effect change. \"We have to wake up our consciences and we can do that by having a deliberate policy, so that it becomes part of everyday life. \"It has to become something we do.\" Buffong adds that he is \"in favour of anything that gets an instant result\". \"Targets, quotas, ringfencing money - I'm in favour of making it happen now. \"The idea of more initiatives and training is so over. There's a wealth of people who just need the opportunity to work.\" Ali says those opportunities may be hampered by the law, which \"in some ways\" supports equality, but also has grey areas. \"There are exemptions from the duty not to discriminate where appropriate and casting is one of those. \"If you are casting for realism purposes or because of the way a character is written, that is permitted, so you could argue that exemption has worked against progress. \"I understand that we're talking about an artistic process, but we must recognise it is an industrial one, and decisions made have an impact disproportionately on working opportunities. \"It's a difficult and thorny question because there are pros and cons on both sides.\" Essiedu believes the answer may be a simple one. \"We mimic what we see, so we need to put that in front of people to get that machine started. \"I'd never seen a black actor performing the lead in a Shakespeare play until I was 18 and I saw Chiwetel Ejiofor doing Othello in the Donmar Warehouse. \"Because I hadn't seen it, I didn't think it was possible and I didn't explore that avenue. \"People from whatever background are only going to be inspired to write or perform if they see it. \"If you've got an artistic director who is willing to try and fail, then you're going to get a wider palette of works. \"Some of it will probably be terrible, but some of it will be unbelievably brilliant.\" Hamlet is in cinemas from 8 June and at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon 13 August.", "text": ["On", "stage", ",",

"Quite where he was when the return leg was happening is unclear, because when that's spoken of he shakes his head as if trying to flick the memory of it out of his brain. \"How many points were Rangers behind Celtic last season?\" he asks. Thirty-nine is the answer. \"No,\" he replies. Not \"no\" as in he doesn't believe it, but \"no\" as in he doesn't want to believe it, doesn't want to accept it. It's got to be hard for a player like Mols, and the legions of other foreign players who did great things at Ibrox, to fathom what has happened at their old club these past years. They watch from a distance unsure of what on earth is happening. Their memory of Rangers is of a club in a relentless pursuit of titles, either as champions or challenger to Celtic. Those days are still vivid to him. The first trip to Glasgow and Dick Advocaat waiting for him at the airport. The drive to Ibrox and the big sell from his fellow Dutchman. Advocaat told him that if he thought Ibrox was impressive as an empty stadium then he should sign on the dotted and hear what it was like when it was full. He did, for \u00a34m. \"Dick was a football fanatic,\" Mols says. \"Football was, and is, his life. He knew everything about an opponent. Watched every game, even if it was an amateur team from Iceland. He liked to control everything, even the kit. He asked for our shorts to be made shorter once because he thought it would make us quicker. I didn't like it so I asked the kit man for an old, longer pair. Dick saw them and gave the kit man dog's abuse. That was Advocaat.\" Mols tells a story about his time in Glasgow. The back-drop was this: he had joined Rangers from Utrecht in the summer of 1999 and from early on he looked a pedigree striker. He scored two goals on his debut against FC Haka in the Champions League, scored four against Motherwell and scored two in a 4-1 rout of a PSV Eindhoven team that had the celebrated pair of Ruud van Nistelrooy and Luc Nilis playing up front. After scoring 13 goals in his first 20 games, Mols was a star. Then a terrible injury against Bayern Munich in the first week of November cast him into darkness. He missed the rest of the season and struggled to make much of an impression for the two seasons after that before being told that the then Rangers manager, Alex McLeish, wanted to offload him. \"It was hard because I had to play in the U-21s, I needed the stadium, I needed the excitement. You see the team sheet and you're not in the squad and those are hard moments. At the end of the season the manager came to me and said, 'You can leave if you can find another club. We won't make it hard for you.' I went for a trial with Sunderland.\" Happily for Mols, and Rangers, the deal fell through. He won his place back, started scoring again, and ended up helping break Celtic's dominance under Martin O'Neill by winning the treble. You'd have thought that the final day drama against Dunfermline - and victory in the league by a solitary goal - would have been the high-point of his Rangers career, but he says it wasn't. It was unforgettable, but it wasn't the best. \"Winning that league title was just an explosion of joy. The two minutes we spent waiting for Celtic's result to come through were the longest two minutes of my life. For me, the most special moment was the League Cup in 2003. It was my first trophy after my injury. When I lifted the cup it was my dream come true because the reason I signed for Rangers was to win prizes and play Champions League. After my injury, I thought my dream was finished. \"I still follow Rangers. When you leave, you're not a player anymore, but you become a supporter.\" To emphasise it, he says that the administration and liquidation of Rangers in those fateful days five years ago \"killed Scottish football\". Not many outside of Ibrox would agree, but Mols doesn't care much about that. \"How many leagues have Celtic won now?\" Six-in-a-row. \"But four without Rangers. The challenge was always Rangers and Celtic. It wasn't a challenge for four years, so you think it's an achievement winning six-in-a-row or not? For me, Celtic winning the four years Rangers weren't there, I don't think it's an achievement. No.\" It's not an opinion he expects many outside Rangers to share. He's 750 miles away in Amsterdam, but there's no escaping certain things. The EBT chat? He's heard it - his was worth \u00a3260,000 - and here's his take on it. \"I just wanted to play for Rangers, I would have played for petrol money. I didn't tell them that. They say, 'You can help the club by doing it this way'. I said, 'OK, as long as I don't get into trouble'. They put it on a letter and at the end of the day the responsibility is with the club. My agent agreed and also the guy who was doing the tax, because I don't have a clue about that. I assumed they had the knowledge about it. I agreed with it. I said, 'No problem, as long as I don't get into trouble.' \"I think he (Sir David Murray) knew what he was doing. It's hard to put the club in that situation. I wouldn't do that. It affected so many people who are following Rangers and you see the result. Four leagues down. It affected the whole of Scottish football. Yeah I would blame him or his advisors.\" The title-stripping furore? That's carried on the wind from Glasgow to Amsterdam as well. \"I don't even know where my medals are. They can take away my medals or my titles but they can't take away my memory. I won on the pitch. If Aberdeen did the same, EBTs, would they become champions? Or the guy from Dundee United (Stephen Thompson) who makes a lot of talking about that? Would they become champions? I don't think so. They need to move on now. Think about their own situation. They (United) need to worry about getting back to the Premier League.\" Mols tries to remember the first time he played a competitive game for Rangers with Kenny Miller. It was a long time ago, he knows that much. A long, long time ago. Fifteen years, sixteen years? Was it Dundee away? It was. Seventeen years ago next month. Neil McCann for Rangers, Juan Sara for Dundee. A 1-1 draw. \"And he's still playing. Kenny's an example of how to be a real professional. I saw him playing a couple of weeks ago and he still has the desire and the passion and that's what the team needs. The hardest thing for new players at a club like Rangers, especially new foreign players, is learning what it means to play for a club like that. They can become sloppy or less professional, but if they look at Kenny, they'll understand. He's 37 and he still wants it.\" On Sunday, against Motherwell at Fir Park, we can start analysing Rangers anew - and in his corner of south Amsterdam, Mols will be watching and hoping. \"When will they challenge Celtic? As soon as possible. I wish it was yesterday.\"", "text": ["Quite", "where", "he", "was", "when", "the", "return", "leg", "was", "happening", "is", "unclear", ",", "because", "when", "that", "'s", "spoken", "of", "he",

Yet he was back less than 12 hours later, some say in an even stronger position than before. And he had out-manoeuvred the plotters. To his supporters he has brought Turkey years of economic growth, but to his critics he is an autocratic leader intolerant of dissent who harshly silences anyone who opposes him. And dissenters range from a 16-year-old arrested for insulting the president to a former Miss Turkey who got into trouble for sharing a poem critical of the Turkish president. The failed coup claimed at least 240 lives and, according to his officials, also came close to killing Mr Erdogan, who had been staying at the Aegean holiday resort of Marmaris. Within hours, he appeared on national TV and rallied supporters in Istanbul, declaring he was the \"chief commander\". But the strain on the president was clear, when he sobbed openly while giving a speech at the funeral of a close friend, shot with his son by soldiers during the attempted coup. Mr Erdogan, 62, came to power in 2002, a year after the formation of the AK Party (AKP). He spent 11 years as Turkey's prime minister before becoming the country's first directly-elected president in August 2014 - a supposedly ceremonial role. He is known to harbour ambitions of creating an executive presidency, to regain some of the powers he relinquished when his tenure as prime minister ended in 2014. While the AKP enjoys a fierce and loyal support among Turkey's conservative, Muslim base, his silencing of critics has caused alarm abroad. Turkish journalists have been investigated and put on trial, foreign journalists have been harassed and deported. And Mr Erdogan's authoritarian approach is not confined to Turkey's borders. His bodyguards harassed reporters in the US, and a German satirist is under investigation in his home country for offending the Turkish president on TV. In June 2015 the AKP suffered a dip in the polls and failed to form a coalition. But the party swept back to power in November with 49% of the vote, in elections overshadowed by the end of a ceasefire with the Kurdish militant PKK. Born in 1954, Recep Tayyip Erdogan grew up the son of a coastguard, on Turkey's Black Sea coast. When he was 13, his father decided to move to Istanbul, hoping to give his five children a better upbringing. As a teenager, the young Erdogan sold lemonade and sesame buns on the streets of Istanbul's rougher districts to earn extra cash. He attended an Islamic school before obtaining a degree in management from Istanbul's Marmara University - and playing professional football. 1970s-1980s - Active in Islamist circles, member of Necmettin Erbakan's Welfare Party 1994-1998 - Mayor of Istanbul, until military officers made power grab 1998 - Welfare Party banned, Erdogan jailed for four months for inciting religious hatred Aug 2001 - Founds Islamist-rooted AKP (Justice and Development Party) with ally Abdullah Gul 2002-2003 - AKP wins solid majority in parliamentary election, Erdogan appointed prime minister Aug 2014 - Becomes president after first-ever direct elections for head of state July 2016 - Survives attempted coup by factions within the military In the decades before the AKP's rise to power, the military intervened in politics four times to curb Islamist influence. And Recep Tayyip Erdogan has for years embraced Islamist-rooted politics. When he became mayor of Istanbul in 1994 he stood as candidate for the pro-Islamist Welfare Party. He went to jail for four months in 1999 for religious incitement after he publicly read a nationalist poem including the lines: \"The mosques are our barracks, the domes our helmets, the minarets our bayonets and the faithful our soldiers.\" When he became prime minister in 2002 as head of the AKP, he asserted civilian supremacy over the army. In 2013 he triumphed over the military elite when senior officers were among a large group of people convicted of plotting to overthrow him in what was known as the \"Ergenekon\" case. Those convictions were later quashed. Critics have accused Mr Erdogan of using the judiciary to silence political opponents, and there have been many allegations of trumped-up charges. But his supporters applauded him for taking on previously untouchable establishment figures, who saw themselves as guardians of the state created by Ataturk. Mr Erdogan also unleashed the power of the state to crush mass protests in Istanbul in June 2013, focused on Gezi Park, a green area earmarked for a huge building project. The protests spread to other cities, swelled by many secularist Turks suspicious of the AKP's Islamist leanings. A major corruption scandal battered his government in December 2013, involving numerous arrests, including the sons of three cabinet ministers. Mr Erdogan raged against \"plotters\" based outside Turkey, condemning supporters of cleric Fethullah Gulen, a former ally turned rival in self-imposed exile in the US. He also lashed out against social media, vowing to \"wipe out\" Twitter. Mr Erdogan has denied wanting to impose Islamic values, saying he is committed to secularism. But he supports Turks' right to express their religious beliefs more openly. That message goes down particularly well in rural and small-town Anatolia - the AKP's traditional heartland. Some supporters nicknamed him \"Sultan\" - harking back to the Ottoman Empire. In October 2013 Turkey lifted rules banning women from wearing headscarves in the country's state institutions - with the exception of the judiciary, military and police - ending a decades-old restriction. Critics also pointed to Mr Erdogan's failed bid to criminalise adultery, and his attempts to introduce \"alcohol-free zones\", as evidence of his alleged Islamist intentions. Mr Erdogan's political opponents saw a lavish new presidential palace as a symbol of his alleged authoritarian tendencies. Perched on a hill on the outskirts of Ankara, the 1,000-room Ak Saray (White Palace) is bigger than the White House or the Kremlin and ended up costing even more than the original \u00c2\u00a3385m ($615m) price tag. Mr Erdogan owes much of his political success in the past decade to economic stability, with an average annual growth rate of 4.5%. Turkey has developed into a manufacturing and export powerhouse. The AKP government kept inflation under control - no mean feat, as there were years in the 1990s when it soared above 100%. But in 2014 the economy began flagging - growth fell to 2.9% and unemployment rose above 10%. On the international stage he has bitterly condemned Israel - previously a strong ally of Turkey - over its treatment of the Palestinians. Although there is now a rapprochement, the policy not only galvanised his Islamic base, but also made him a hugely popular leader across the Middle East.

sardonic humour and the inevitable raised eyebrow. He eventually became the longest-serving actor in the role, his seven Bond films becoming the most commercially successful of the franchise. His tenure in the role also showcased an array of implausible gadgets and a host of new characters, designed to flesh out Ian Fleming's original plots. Roger George Moore was born in Stockwell, south London on 14 October 1927, the son of a policeman. At 15, he entered art college, and later became an apprentice at an animation studio, where it seems much fun was had at his expense. \"I was probably the lowliest in the entire building,\" he said. \"They sent me on errands for things like tins of sprocket holes, and the guy in stores would say he didn't have any - and would rainbow paint do instead?\" Sir Roger was sacked for incompetence, but soon had a stroke of luck. His father, by now a detective sergeant, was called to investigate a robbery at the home of the film director, Brian Desmond Hurst. DS Moore managed to effect an introduction that led to his son being hired as an extra for the epic, Caesar and Cleopatra. Hurst paid for Sir Roger to study at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, before a spell of National Service with the Army where he rose to the rank of captain. On his return to the theatre, he found acting roles hard to come by but his well-toned physique meant he was in demand as a model. One of his engagements was playing the doctor in Woman's Own medical features. He also appeared, suitably attired in a sweater, on a number of knitting patterns, prompting at least one wag to christen him the Big Knit. And in 1953, his looks and his minor roles in theatre and television plays impressed an MGM talent scout and Sir Roger set off for America. Married at 17 to a fellow Rada student, Doorn Van Steyn, he was by now living with the singer Dorothy Squires, 12 years his senior, who soon became his second wife at a ceremony in New Jersey. While Squires was popular in Britain, Sir Roger was rubbing shoulders with stars in the States, making his film debut with Elizabeth Taylor in The Last Time I Saw Paris and playing Lana Turner's leading man in Diane. But it was through television that he first made his mark, as the dashing hero Ivanhoe in a 1950s series that had only a tentative connection with Sir Walter Scott's original novel. He followed that with the lead role in an American TV series The Alaskans. It was not a great success. Despite being set in Alaska, it was filmed on a hot Hollywood set with the cast dressed up in furs. Moore found the filming difficult and an affair with actress Dorothy Provine did nothing to relieve the pressure. He also appeared in the successful Western series Maverick, where he had the role of Beau Maverick, supposedly the English cousin of the lead character Brett, played by James Garner. Ironically Sir Sean Connery had also tested for the part but turned it down. Sir Roger's big breakthrough came in 1962 when the impresario Lew Grade cast him as the dashing Simon Templar aka The Saint, in a television adaptation of the Leslie Charteris stories. The series, which ran for seven years, made Sir Roger a star on both sides of the Atlantic. Many of the Saint's characteristics, the easygoing manner, mocking eyebrow and ability to successfully charm every passing female, would later be incorporated into his role as James Bond. In 1971 he teamed up with Tony Curtis in the TV series The Persuaders, as one of two wise-cracking millionaire playboys who floated around the fleshpots of the globe as a pair of freelance secret agents. The success of the series owed a lot to the contrast of the rough-hewn New Yorker Danny Wilde, played by Curtis, and Sir Roger's suave Lord Brett Sinclair. Sir Roger always denied that he had been considered as James Bond when the franchise launched in 1962 and was only aware of interest in him when Sir Sean announced, in 1966, that he would no longer play the role. There was a long wait. George Lazenby was cast in the 1969 film On Her Majesty's Secret Service and Sir Sean was tempted back with an offer of \u00c2\u00a31.5m, a huge sum in those days, to make Diamonds Are Forever. It really was the last appearance for Sir Sean and Sir Roger finally picked up the Walther PPK in 1973 for Live and Let Die. He went on to make six more films, including The Spy Who Loved Me and Octopussy, before bowing out of the role at the age of 57 with A View to a Kill. It was his last film appearance for five years. Sir Roger had some success in films such as Shout at the Devil, The Wild Geese and North Sea Hijack, but many of the newspaper headlines after he retired as Bond were about his life off screen. In 1963, he became a father, when his partner, Luisa Mattioli, had a daughter, but it was to be another five years before Dorothy Squires agreed to give Sir Roger a divorce. He married Luisa and they had two sons, but after 38 years, Sir Roger left her and they were divorced. He married his fourth wife, Kiki Tholstrup, in March 2002. Sir Roger recovered from an operation for prostate cancer in 1993 and said he had led \"an extraordinarily lucky, charmed life\". He had homes in Switzerland and Monte Carlo, but devoted much of his time to travelling the globe as a roving ambassador for the United Nations children's organisation Unicef, a role prompted by the scenes of child poverty he had witnessed in India while filming Octopussy. He took up the position at the request of his friend and predecessor, Audrey Hepburn. His work was recognised by a CBE in 1998 and he was knighted in 2003. Throughout his life Sir Roger cut a suave figure, always immaculately dressed. In 2015 he was awarded the accolade of one of GQ magazine's best-dressed men. He was a lifelong supporter of the Conservative Party, giving his backing to David Cameron in 2011 when the prime minister faced criticism over his policy on the EU. Despite his other work and achievements, Roger Moore never managed to quite shrug off the mantle of 007. \"Of course I do not regret the Bond days,\" he once remarked. \"I regret that sadly heroes in general are depicted with guns in their hands, and to tell the truth I have always hated guns and what they represent.\" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

But he also attacked David Cameron's \"shocking broken promises\" and said Labour would \"challenge austerity\". And he restated his belief in getting rid of Britain's nuclear weapons. Mr Corbyn arrived on stage in Brighton to a lengthy standing ovation from Labour delegates and his shadow cabinet, before delivering a 59 minute speech that eschewed the traditional section on the leader's family and background. There were jokes - he took a swipe at some of the press coverage he has received since his surprise Labour leadership victory - but he also spoke at length, and off the cuff, about his values and how he planned to change his party. There were no policy announcements but he covered a broad range of issues including: Following the speech, it was revealed a large section was based on a blog written in 2011. Speechwriter Richard Heller wrote the passages and they were offered to previous Labour leader Ed Miliband, but not used. Mr Heller told the BBC he had written to offer them to Mr Corbyn shortly after his election as leader, and had been \"surprised\" and \"very glad\" they were eventually used. He had been informed by Mr Corbyn's office on Tuesday afternoon that the passages were to be used, he added. In his speech, Mr Corbyn addressed head-on David Cameron's claim that he represented a threat to the security of British families. \"How dare these people talk about security for families and people in Britain? There's no security for the 2.8 million households in Britain forced into problem debt by stagnating wages and the Tory record of the longest fall in living standards since records began,\" he said. \"And that's the nub of it. Tory economic failure. An economy that works for the few, not for the many.\" The thirst in the hall for him to do well was tangible. Some members of the party have wanted to hear a speech like this for years. And although he never really expected to be doing one of the most high-profile, hardest jobs in politics, if Jeremy Corbyn was nervous, he didn't show it. And goodness me, the audience was pleased to see him, applauding for two minutes on their feet before he even said a word. Inside the hall his clarion calls, as he even highlighted, \"strong message here\", were eagerly received, even though I caught the eyes of a fair number of stony-faced MPs. Read Laura's blog in full He told Labour activists he was \"unapologetic about reforming our economy to challenge inequality and protect workers better\" and said people should not have to accept what was given to them by global corporations, and there should be no limit on what they could achieve. \"We are a rich country. These things are not necessary or inevitable. They can and must be changed.\" He said most British people shared his values, adding: \"I know there's a big British majority for building a more equal society, for eliminating poverty and homelessness.\" Contrary to some predictions, Mr Corbyn did not use the speech to issue an apology for the Labour Party's role in taking Britain to war in Iraq under Tony Blair. But he told the packed hall: \"It didn't help our national security when we went to war with Iraq in defiance of the United Nations and on a false prospectus.\" And he signalled his opposition to any government attempt to secure Parliament's support for military action in Syria, saying a \"diplomatic strategy\" via the United Nations could secure peace. He repeated his opposition to renewing the Trident nuclear weapons system, a stance not shared by his shadow defence secretary Maria Eagle, who he has asked to lead a review on the issue, but added the jobs and skills of people working in the defence industry had to be protected \"so that we gain from this, we do not lose from this\". And he attacked the \"commentariat\" for reporting \"splits\" in his top team, saying \"this is grown-up, real politics where real people debate real issues\". To a standing ovation, he added: \"Cut out the personal abuse, cut out the cyber bullying, and especially cut out the misogynistic abuse. \"Let's get on with bringing real values back into politics.\" His approach of allowing shadow Cabinet members to speak freely on issues where they disagree with him will continue. \"I am not imposing leadership lines. I don't believe anyone has a monopoly on wisdom - we all have ideas and a vision of how things can be better,\" he said. \"I want open debate, I will listen to everyone, I firmly believe leadership is listening.\" The \"huge mandate\" he had been given as leader was a \"mandate for change\", he said \"It was a vote for change in the way we do politics, in the Labour Party and the country.\" BBC deputy political editor James Landale said the speech was \"directed at the Labour Party itself\", with \"not much of a message for the outside world\", but added that a reference to aspiration was \"the germ of an interesting idea\". For the Conservatives, Justice Secretary Michael Gove said: \"The Labour leader's policies to borrow more, print money and put up taxes on people's jobs and incomes would wreck our economy. That would weaken our nation's defences, damage our NHS and hurt our country's working people - with the poorest hit the most.\" UKIP called the speech \"fantastical\", saying: \"His politics are underpinned by a naive and optimistic view of the world that is so shortsighted it is frankly dangerous. \"His words are like inspirational memes. Beguiling as they may be they all belong to a virtual world.\" A succession of union leaders welcomed the speech, saying there was now a \"true\" opposition. Mark Serwotka, PCS general secretary, said Mr Corbyn had \"brilliantly answered his critics\", while the Fire Brigades Union's Matt Wrack said the speech could mark a \"turning point in British politics\". Business groups questioned some of Mr Corbyn's message, however. The British Chambers of Commerce said businesses would \"not like the thought of an interventionist state propping up failing companies\" and renationalising utilities, while the CBI said it shared Labour's aim of spreading the proceeds of growth but \"we don't recognise Mr Corbyn's characterisation of the economy\".", "text": ["In", "his", "first", "conference", "speech", "after", "becoming",

sense of humour.\" Allen, from Narberth, is the second youngest of four children; Kate, Harry - who has represented Great Britain's Deaf football team - and 17-year-old Amy. \"We're a very sporty family and football has always been important to us as a family,\" Kate explained. \"Even our mum is a big fan and I sometimes catch her watching random La Liga games. \"Joe was only nine when he started playing for Swansea and even though he was young we could see he stood out. \"He also had the commitment and I can't ever remember him missing a training session. \"We all know it's something that was important to him and we're proud he's had success. \"I never had any doubt he would have success in his career.\" Allen came through the ranks at Swansea City and played in the Championship play-off final win over Reading in 2011 which secured promotion to the Premier League. Established as a Welsh international after making his debut against Estonia in 2009, Allen left the Liberty Stadium for Liverpool in the summer of 2012. \"I couldn't believe it,\" Amy said of her older brother's \u00c2\u00a315m move to the Anfield giants. \"Liverpool are such a big club and, in school, a lot of the children supported Liverpool. Kate added: \"The scrutiny is on another level compared to Swansea. \"Liverpool have so many supporters across the world and everyone has an opinion. \"It was surreal seeing him on the television and the fact at one time he was playing with Steven Gerrard and other famous people. \"By now we've got used to it and he hasn't changed a bit. Joe is Joe. He's a very down to earth person.\" Allen made a surprise appearance on the front cover of Chicken & Egg magazine in March, and Kate says Joe shares a passion for animals with his wife Lacey. \"They don't just keep chickens,\" Kate told BBC Radio Cymru. \"They've got two goats, two Shetland ponies and dogs. That's definitely the influence of his wife Lacey. \"She does a lot with the RSPCA and I believe they donated money they had for their wedding towards the charity.\" Allen has also developed a new look during a season in which he helped Liverpool reach the finals of the League Cup and Europa League. Sporting longer hair and a beard to rival that of Wales team-mate Joe Ledley, he has been likened to Italian footballer Andrea Pirlo. And his new look has the approval of his sisters. \"He looks older,\" Amy joked. \"Without it he looks younger and I think with the beard he's played well.\" Ben Davies remains close to his family in Wales even though his footballing career has taken him to London and a career with Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League. Davies started training with Swansea as a seven-year-old and signed his first apprenticeship with the club when he was 16, leaving Welsh language secondary Ysgol Gyfun Ystalyfera after his GCSEs. \"He enjoys being home and he's very close to his family,\" his mother, Eryl told BBC Radio Cymru's Byd y Belles series. \"He enjoys being with his friends either at the cricket club, friends he made when he was younger when he played football and the friends he's made in London. \"Ben played rugby for the school, football and cricket in the summer.\" Davies made his international debut against Scotland in a World Cup qualifier in 2015. It was whirlwind couple of months not only for the then 19-year-old from Neath but also his family. \"He started playing in Swansea City's first team and the next thing he was training with Wales' senior team,\" Eryl said. \"The next thing, we were going to Cardiff to see him play against Scotland. It was a bit of a shock and I didn't know what to expect. \"It was exciting and I was fairly nervous, but it was a lovely day and special for us all as a family.\" Davies' opportunity with Swansea and Wales came after team-mate Neil Taylor suffered a serious ankle injury early in the 2012-13 season. His rapid rise to prominence surprised many seasoned football observers, but not his sister Hannah. \"People at school always used to ask me was it a shock that my brother was doing so well,\" she said. \"No it wasn't because I always knew he was going to be successful and were just waiting for it to happen. \"It happened so quickly when he started for Swansea's first team and things went on from there. \"He's a very determined lad but he takes everything in his stride and goes through life being happy. \"He's always reading something. We always see pictures on Twitter of his team-mates making fun of him. \"They've got their iPads and listening to music and he's got a book. He likes general knowledge quizzes and knows everything.\" College commitments mean Hannah can only attend one of Wales' games but Eryl and husband Alun plan to be in France for the duration. \"There will be a lot of travelling from one place to another but hopefully it will be worth it and we can't wait to go now,\" Eryl added. Neil Taylor's devotion to football from an early age has seen him establish himself as a Premier League and international regular. Born in St Asaph and raised in Ruthin, Denbighshire, Taylor began his career as a youngster at Manchester City but left at 15 and joined Wrexham. He made his professional debut at Wrexham and it was while he was with the Dragons that he made his Wales debut against Croatia in May 2010. A few weeks later he joined Swansea City and was part of the team that would secure their place in the Premier League. \"Ever since he was a child that's all he's wanted to do, play football,\" Shibani Taylor says of her 27-year-old son. \"Even when he was a young boy, he's never veered away from football. \"He missed all his school discos and friends' birthday parties because, at that time, he was playing for Manchester City. \"We'd drive him three times a week to Manchester and back when he was about nine or 10 and not once did he say, 'Mum, do I have to go?' \"He used to sit in the back of the car and do his homework. \"We're going to France to cheer him on. We're hoping they win at least two out of three games. They've got a very good team.\" Shibani and husband John will not be the only members of the Taylor family going over to France to support Wales this summer as wife Jenna will also be attending two of the games. Wales' first appearance at a major tournament since 1958 means Neil and his team-mates will be away from their families for a minimum of four weeks, dependant on Wales' progress. Taylor returned to hometown Ruthin for a brief visit in between the end of the Premier League season and reporting for Wales duty. \"I'm quite used to Neil being away,\" Jenna said. \"We'll miss him, but we know he's doing something that's been his dream and we're really supportive. \"We're incredibly proud of him and he's worked really hard. We've seen all the sacrifices he has had to make.\" Full interviews with the families of Joe Allen and Ben Davies can be heard in a two part programme, Straeon Bob Lliw - Byd y Belles, on BBC Radio Cymru.

For decades, it has been well known that aircraft are prime targets for terrorist attacks. A relatively small explosion is capable of bringing down a large aircraft, inflicting numerous casualties. Even before the cause of the Metrojet crash was known for certain, leading figures within the industry were warning that changes would be needed. The chief executive of Easyjet, Carolyn McCall, recently told the BBC that the idea of a bomb on board an aircraft \"kept airline chief executives awake at night\". She added that in \"certain airports\" around the world, standards simply weren't good enough. Her comments echoed a warning from the UK's Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond, who said that travellers could face delays and extra costs as a result. Global standards for airport security do already exist. They are laid down in Annex 17 of the Chicago Convention, a document that effectively sets out international rules for the air transport industry. It states, for example, that both passengers and baggage should be screened before being allowed aboard an aircraft. However, these are only minimum requirements. It is up to individual governments to decide how to implement them, and of course the airport itself has to abide by those national procedures. In practice, this means that standards can vary widely. Security in major hubs such as London Heathrow is generally very good, with state of the art technology being used by well-trained staff. But in regional airports, particularly in the developing world, standards can be more lax. Organisations such as the US Transportation Security Administration have overseas representatives whose job is to help foreign governments boost security, but experts say the results have been mixed. In any case, standards can slip almost anywhere. The TSA itself came in for heavy criticism earlier this year, when government agents managed to smuggle fake weapons and explosives through security at US airports in 67 out of 70 attempts. So what can be done to improve matters? Physical checks on passengers were dramatically tightened up after the 9/11 attacks, and the subsequent attempt to bring down another aircraft by the \"shoe bomber\" Richard Reid. Further measures were introduced after the unsuccessful liquid bomb plot of 2006. Even today, it's not uncommon to be asked to remove shoes when passing through security, while curbs on carrying liquids have been eased somewhat, but remain in force. According to Ben Vogel, editor of Jane's Airport Review, there is no need for further restrictions of this sort. \"If tighter screening controls are introduced,\" he says, \"it would run counter to aviation policies over recent years.\" \"The talk in recent times has been about intelligence-based, risk-based screening. Risk-based protocols rely less on a blanket one-size-fits-all method, and use a more nuanced approach that focuses on 'persons of interest'.\" Matthew Finn, managing director of security consultancy Augmentiq, agrees. \"We cannot continue to view every passenger as posing the same amount of risk,\" he says. \"The 85-year-old grandmother and the 3-year-old toddler do not pose the same amount of risk as someone who might already be known to the authorities, travelling on a one-way ticket to a destination that gives us cause for concern.\" Such an approach might actually be welcomed by passengers. Current security procedures can be very time consuming, while some people find them embarrassing and undignified. But those in favour of greater risk profiling say it would allow most people to undergo less intense screening, potentially reducing delays and stress at the airport. However, many experts believe the priority now should be to focus, not on passengers, but on the people who actually work within the airport. Security staff, for example, are often low paid and poorly trained. In countries where corruption is endemic, there is a risk they could be paid to turn a blind eye to potentially suspect baggage. Low morale, meanwhile, can mean experienced staff leave the industry, depriving it of much-needed expertise. \"The technology, manpower and procedures at airports are only effective if they are deployed correctly\", says Matthew Finn. \"We've got to move away from low wages, tenuous contracts and minimal opportunities to create a culture that recognises high performers.\" But security staff are not the only airport workers under scrutiny. Anyone who works \"airside\", beyond the security screen is potentially a risk. That includes people like baggage handlers, bus drivers, maintenance staff and engineers. \"It only takes one person, one 'bad egg' to cause a disaster,\" Philip Baum, editor of Aviation Security International, told the BBC. \"We've seen a multitude of incidents around the world where airport employees have been engaged in human trafficking, drug trafficking \"But\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it could easily be an improvised explosive device that's infiltrated, for example.\" Mathew Finn of Augmentiq thinks that, like passengers, airport staff should be subjected to more risk-based screening. \"We've spent incredible amounts of money focusing on what passengers may have in their bags, but nowhere near enough on who is being screened at security or who is working in restricted areas of the airport,\" he says. One thing the airports themselves do not want to see is increased regulation. According to Angela Gittens, director of the industry group ACI World, that would be \"counterproductive\". However, it is fair to say the loss of flight Metrojet KGL9268 has put the security of airports under an intense spotlight - and the \"inside threat\" posed by airside workers is being taken more seriously than ever.", "text": ["Some", "security", "experts", "say", "what", "is", "needed", "is", "more", "intelligence-based", ",", "risk-based", "screenings", "of", "both", "passengers", "-",

And who will succeed Chelsea's Eden Hazard as the winner? Ten BBC football pundits - Alan Shearer, Chris Waddle, Chris Sutton, Jermaine Jenas, Danny Murphy, Danny Mills, Kevin Kilbane, Pat Nevin, Mark Lawrenson and John Hartson - have revealed their six outstanding performers of 2015-16. Scroll down to see who they have picked as their best player. Shearer: \"There are so many options for Player of the Year because there are so many questions still to be answered. \"If Harry Kane goes and scores six goals in Tottenham's last six games and they win the title, then it is him. If Jamie Vardy does the same for Leicester, he gets it. \"But if the season ended now, when the votes are being cast, I would go for Riyad Mahrez. \"He has brought brilliance and unpredictability to Leicester's title bid, and has been superb in terms of scoring goals, and making them.\" Waddle: \"I have always felt the vote was too early, going back to when I was a player. \"That's why I think Arsenal's Mesut Ozil will figure this year because when voting started he was on fire, even though he has gone off the boil a bit in the last few weeks. \"The award should reflect performances over the whole season, which is why a Leicester player should get it. \"As a Premier League footballer, Mahrez has basically come alive this season after showing a few glimpses of his ability at the end of 2014-15 when Leicester avoided relegation. \"My other contenders come from clubs near the top, apart from Willian, who has had a fantastic season even though Chelsea have been terrible. He is their only player to get close to the level he was at when they won the title last season.\" Sutton: \"I am a big fan of Robert Huth's old-fashioned defending, although I could easily have picked his team-mate Wes Morgan instead. \"Jamie Vardy has been absolutely sensational and is a far more intelligent player than people give him credit for. Yes he is fast and works hard, but the timing of his runs is terrific and we know he can finish. \"There are strong arguments for Vardy or Mahrez to be player of the year but, for me, Dimitri Payet has had the 'wow' factor. \"Payet cost West Ham just under \u00a311m when he joined from Marseille in the summer. That is just run-of-the-mill money these days so I did not pay much attention to the signing at the time, but he has been a breath of fresh air. \"Watching the way West Ham play with Payet in the team is a bit like being back at school. He is their best player so they give him the ball and say 'make something happen' - and he does. \"He has got that unbelievable eye for a pass, on top of his free-kick ability, and he is one of those players who is a reason why fans buy tickets or turn on the TV. \"If I could watch him play every week I would. In fact, I would watch him train every day if I could - he has been that good.\" Jenas: \"Arsenal's form dropping off when it did will not have helped Ozil's chances. I still think he has been brilliant, though. \"There were a lot of question marks over him before the season started about whether he was doing enough to justify his \u00a342m fee, so he deserves some recognition for all those assists and how he held the mantle for their title bid for so long. \"Mahrez should take the award, though. If Leicester win the league, it will be because of him. \"Although Vardy has scored more goals, Mahrez has put a lot of them on a plate for him.\" Murphy: \"What I love about Toby Alderweireld is that he is a superb defender who contributes to Tottenham's attacks too. \"He is so calm in possession and some of his long-range passing has been phenomenal to set Spurs off going forward. \"He has played every minute for Tottenham in the Premier League this season and we have seen how he is more than just a great player, he is a leader and an organiser too. \"Jan Vertonghen does not look as solid when he is playing with anyone else and, when he has been injured, Kevin Wimmer has benefited from playing with Alderweireld too. \"As far as the Player of the Year goes, though, it has to be Mahrez. What he has achieved has been phenomenal. \"Jamie Vardy's performances have been completely unexpected as well but, when you bring in Mahrez's all-round game and the big moments when he has delivered, he would edge it for me.\" Mills: \"After he broke through last season, nobody was sure Harry Kane could do it again, but he has done. \"What I like about him is that he does not have blistering pace; instead he is a very clever player. \"To score the number of goals he has, two seasons running, and be in line to be the first English striker to win the Premier League's golden boot since Kevin Phillips in 2000, is amazing enough anyway. To do it at the age of 22 is phenomenal.\" Kilbane: \"You could argue a case for so many different players - Romelu Lukaku has scored 25 goals for Everton, so he would get into my six ahead of people like Eric Dier and Alderweireld, who have been so solid for Spurs. \"Different players will have different criteria for who gets their vote - some current top-flight players I have spoken to have given it to the player who played the best against them, while when I had a vote I would have made my decision based on the games I watched too. \"In terms of a winner, it is hard to look beyond Leicester, and Mahrez and Vardy are one and two for me. \"Before Christmas, Vardy broke the Premier League record for scoring in consecutive games but, for eye-catching performances over the whole season, I would go with Mahrez.\" Nevin: \"Manchester United are where they are in the table because of David de Gea more than any other player and I suspect he will be their player of the year for a third straight year. \"Kane has answered all the people who doubted him and shown he is top quality but Mahrez gets my vote. \"As someone who played in his position it is obvious he could do things nobody else can do. In terms of his stats, his numbers are spectacular but what makes him so special and skilful is more technical than that - he has got a certain balance about him.\" Lawro: \"Kane did not score in any of Tottenham's first six league games of the season, but since then he has become a brute of a centre-forward and my star of the season. \"He scores every type of goal, from anywhere, and his size, skill, finishing ability, unselfishness and hard work make him stand out at international level too. \"The Leicester trio I have picked in my six are the best individuals in a very effective team unit. \"The front two have scored 35 goals between them - only Kane and Alli get close to that with 29. \"But I just think N'Golo Kante has been a revelation. It seemed to take a little while for everybody to realise what a good player he is. \"Kante has got great pace so he gets to people really quickly to break attacks down, then gets up the pitch too. Danny Drinkwater must love having him as his midfield partner.\" \"As far as the young player award goes, 19-year-old Dele Alli has to win it. \"He is the outstanding talent to break through in the Premier League this season, and with his attitude and application I think he will get better and better. \"I remember the first time I saw Riyad Mahrez play live, when I went to watch Swansea play Leicester at the King Power Stadium in April last year. \"He did not start the game and only came on in the 68th minute, but he was very influential when he did. I remember thinking 'wow, this guy is special'. \"Mahrez's feet are absolutely magnificent - he can score goals, has got great vision, can carry the ball and is a great athlete. He is the biggest reason Leicester are having such an outstanding season.\"", "text": ["So", "who", "should", "be", "on", "the", "six-man", "shortlist", "when", "it", "is", "announced", "on", "14",

blue Catalan pro-independence flags fluttered in the wind. \"War! War! War!\" shouted his commander. This was a re-enactment of events in the 18th Century, but Ramon feels like he is part of an historic struggle in 2015. \"The Spaniards hate us because we're different,\" he told me. \"Really?!\" I said, as I began to explain that I knew plenty of people in Madrid who definitely did not think that way. \"I don't mean each one of them,\" replied Ramon. \"Maybe 60 or 70%. You ask them what they think of the Catalans, they'll tell you they're scum, they're pigs.\" Such language borders on the extreme, and does not reflect reality. But perceptions speak volumes when political tension runs high. And on Catalonia's national day, which was - by no coincidence - also the first day of campaigning ahead of this weekend's crucial regional elections, we met others who had similar thoughts. \"Spain doesn't like us,\" 15-year-old Julia told me. \"The Spanish government is not friendly with Catalonia,\" said Eloy, who was born in Galicia, but grew up in Catalonia. In reality, most of the animosity of the Catalan pro-independence movement is directed at Spain's conservative Popular Party government. In the words of Francisco Camas Garcia, an analyst at Metroscopia, one of Spain's leading polling companies, \"no-one can deny that there is a feeling in Catalonia that they the Catalans have been mistreated by the Spanish government\". In private, the Spanish government admits that mistakes have been made over the handling of the Catalan question. Namely in 2012, when the former Spanish Education Minister, Jose Ignacio Wert, suggested that his department's aim was to make Catalan school children \"more Spanish\". But the government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy accuses the Catalan authorities of manipulating public opinion and fuelling animosity between Catalonia and the rest of Spain. It says regional officials have attempted to blackmail Spain into accepting a referendum by threatening a unilateral declaration of independence and attempting to turn this Sunday's regional election into a vote on whether or not Catalonia should break away from Spain. Madrid, and more accurately people on the right of Spanish politics, are worried. According to the opinion polls, the majority of Catalans want a referendum. Catalonia's governing Convergencia party says the vote is a de-facto referendum on independence from Spain. It has joined forces with the second biggest political party in Catalonia, Esquerra Republicana, to create a single list of candidates, under the banner Together for Yes. They argue they have been forced to do this because the Spanish government has consistently refused to allow a legally recognised referendum. Together for Yes says that if it - together with the far-left pro-independence party Candidatures d'Unitat Popular - wins a majority in the Catalan parliament (68 out of 135 seats), then it will have a \"democratic mandate\" to start a process to create an independent Catalonia. If Together for Yes fails to gain a majority then it would be tantamount to a serious defeat for the pro-independence movement. If Together for Yes wins, as polls suggest it will, it plans to start a transitional period lasting up to 18 months, which in theory would lead to a unilateral declaration of independence. The Spanish government says it will use the country's constitutional court, and other legal means, to block the creation of an \"illegitimate\" Catalan state. Catalonia's quarrel with Spain explained But according to Francisco Camas Garcia of Metroscopia, only about 20% of Catalans support the idea of a unilateral declaration of independence. So Catalans find themselves victims of a political version of cat and mouse. By refusing point-blank to even enter into negotiations on the possibility of a referendum on independence, Mr Rajoy hopes the Catalan secessionist movement will run out of momentum. But the Catalan government says it can use Sunday's election as a vote on independence and will press on regardless of whether Mr Rajoy agrees. Ultimately Artur Mas, the head of Catalonia's regional government, wants to pressurise Madrid into agreeing to a legal referendum. \"That's the game,\" proclaimed Guillermo Sanchez, who had his face painted with the thin red and yellow stripes of the Catalan flag at a pro-independence demonstration at the start of the election campaign. This pro-independence supporter is optimistic that, in the end, the Spanish government will have to sit down and negotiate over a referendum. However Mr Mas said only this week that he was \"sceptical\" that would happen. Some, like flower-shop owner Nieves Sabadell in the town of Hospitalet, which borders Barcelona, believe there are \"much more important issues\" than independence. \"If half of people have lost their homes, don't have jobs and can't feed their children, they the politicians should worry about this.\" But even if opinion remains fairly divided over the pros and cons of independence, what the Catalan authorities have successfully cultivated amongst many Catalans is a grievance that they have been denied the right to vote. Some Spanish politicians, like the new left-wing Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias, oppose Catalan independence but support the idea of a referendum. For now, Catalans will vote on Sunday. If the pro-independence parties win a majority of seats in the Catalan parliament, which most opinion polls predict they will, it will be a step into the unknown.

{"raw_text": "With many Greeks exhausted by five years of recession, tax hikes and record unemployment rates, Syriza and its firebrand leader Alexis Tsipras are tipped to win the early elections that must be called, according to the Greek constitution, if parliament fails to elect a new head of state by 29 December. \"After decades on the defensive, the left is staging a comeback. Not just in Greece, but in Europe and Latin America as well,\" said Mr Samanidis, a top official of Syriza in the country's second city. Alluring as it may prove to Greek voters, the prospect of a leftist party coming to power in Europe's most indebted country is rattling the markets and European capitals. Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras has warned parliamentarians that if they fail to elect a new president, Greece could risk a disastrous exit from the eurozone. The Athens Stock Exchange posted its biggest drop on record on 9 December, while borrowing costs for Greece have skyrocketed amid the political uncertainty. A number of senior European officials have urged voters to support the ruling coalition of conservatives and social democrats. \"I wouldn't like extreme forces to come to power. I would prefer if known faces show up,\" European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker recently told journalists, commenting on the chances of a general election in Greece. While Rosa Luxemburg may adorn its offices, Syriza is not the revolutionary force that her Spartacists represented in Germany a century ago. As the party draws closer to real power, it has softened many of its sharp edges and tried to build bridges, even with City hedge funds. Syriza is vowing to keep Greece within the eurozone and has reassured creditors it will refrain from unilateral decisions on the debt issue. Far from being destructive, Syriza's political proposals offer a reasonable way out of austerity and a chance to replace existing bailout laws with new ones, argues political economist Yanis Varoufakis. \"The first priority is renegotiating with creditors. Syriza needs to speak the language of truth about the continuing triple bankruptcy of the country - public debt, banks, private sector - something no Greek government has done so far. Then they need to table positions that the average German will find reasonable.\" But Syriza and its 40-year-old leader are still seen by many in the Greek and European establishment as unknown and potentially dangerous quantities. Mr Tsipras has warned markets that they \"will have to dance to the tune\" of his government, while Syriza promises to boost public spending, reverse privatisations, increase salaries and pensions and repeal bailout laws liberalising the markets. Nikos Samanidis emphasises that the prospect of power has not blunted the radical nature of the party, despite its meteoric rise from relative obscurity to frontrunner in little over two years. \"The rich, the elites, the markets, the super-rich, the top 10%, yes, they obviously do have reason to worry,\" he says. \"They will lose their privileges. Our voter base has expanded greatly, but the grassroots, radical nature of Syriza has been preserved thanks to the crisis. Our party has not and will not sever its ties with the streets, with the social movements it arose from.\" Syriza was formed in 2004 as a coalition of groups and parties ranging from Maoists to greens. Before 2012 its electoral appeal had been of little consequence for Greece's political system, never exceeding 5% of the vote. It only became a unitary party in 2013. But in 2012, in the apogee of the Greek crisis, Syriza took the political establishment by storm, polling close to 27% in the June general elections and eclipsing the social democrats to become the second-largest party in the country. In the European Parliament elections in May 2014, Syriza emerged victorious, polling close to 27% of the vote. Mr Tsipras, the youngest political leader in Greece's history, was instrumental in transforming Syriza from an also-ran to a potential ruling party. Known for his rhetorical skills, his dislike of neckties and his good looks, Mr Tsipras rose to the leadership of Syriza in 2008 and was elected to parliament in 2009. \"The economic crisis and the collapse of traditional parties certainly helped Syriza grow its influence, but it was Alexis Tsipras who catapulted the party,\" says Christoforos Vernardakis, Professor of Political Science at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and founder of the public opinion survey company VPRC. \"This happened because Tsipras is young and knows no fear. He took a defensive left and turned it into a credible choice for government.\" Despite his undoubted charisma, several Syriza members and officials who know Mr Tsipras personally describe him as \"an everyday, decent person\". \"With Alexis we go a long way back. We used to hang out and I can tell you he is a normal, decent guy. Even as a leader, he likes collective processes and decisions,\" said Mr Samanidis. Critics, on the other hand, see Mr Tsipras as arrogant, inexperienced and power hungry - a maverick politician willing to sacrifice Greece to rise to power. Long-time friend Nikos Karanikas rejects this description of Syriza's \"comrade-president\". \"Although it was clear from the start he was a leader, it took some encouragement from us for him to come forward and take the lead - he had no lust for power,\" said Mr Karanikas, a member of the political bureau of Syriza's largest constituent group, Synaspismos. Tsipras, he argues, still lives in the middle class Athens neighbourhood of Kypseli, and cut his professional teeth while working as a civil engineer. He was one of the \"700-euro generation\" of youth who struggled to advance beyond the average Greek salary. Eager as they are for a historic victory for the left, Syriza officials are also prepared for a long struggle. \"My generation has a chance now with Syriza to stop the disaster. We have no fear of governing,\" said Mr. Karanikas. The party's first battle starts on Wednesday, in the first ballot of the parliamentary election for president. Some analysts predict that renewed fears for Greece's future in the eurozone will convince enough MPs to vote for the government's presidential candidate; or, in the event of a general election, convince enough Greeks to turn the tide in favour of the ruling coalition. Alexis Tsipras has denounced this tactic as an \"operation of terror\" by Prime Minister Samaras and European officials. Some Greeks seem to believe the danger is real, with weekend polls showing that Syriza's lead has narrowed slightly. But others, like Panagiotis Makridis, a waiter at a Greek coffee shop, are enraged by what they say is blatant scaremongering from the government, Brussels and European capitals. \"So Jean-Claude Juncker is telling me who to vote for? I didn't plan on voting Syriza, but now I just might.\"", "text": ["With", "many", "Greeks", "exhausted", "by", "five", "years", "of", "recession", ",", "tax", "hikes", "and", "record",

David Moyes' abysmal reign as manager, when they won 4-1 at Swansea on 17 August 2013. And while this was a symbolic result rather than a statement of title intent, there were events elsewhere that made it a day of Premier League significance. Manager Louis van Gaal can study the table with quiet satisfaction - but he will know this is merely an opening salvo and much work needs to be done. Even so, with City losing and Chelsea's defensive frailties without captain John Terry exposed as they were held to a draw at struggling Newcastle, Van Gaal might be tempted to burst into song once more at Saturday's developments. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho - who has never won a league game on Tyneside - was ultimately grateful for a point after his side came from two goals down late on to earn a draw. It was, however, an unconvincing performance from the reigning champions, who are 15th, and one that suggested plenty of problems still need to be solved before they return to the authority of last season. United's title credentials may become a lot clearer after their next three games, which take them to Arsenal, followed by a trip to Everton that often ends in disappointment then the Manchester derby at Old Trafford on Sunday, 25 October. What is certain is that the cards have fallen in United's favour in recent weeks and suddenly the future looks a lot brighter. The failure of goalkeeper David de Gea's proposed move to Real Madrid followed by the 24-year-old's decision to sign a new four-year deal not only ended uncertainty and lifted the mood around Old Trafford, it meant United could restore a goalkeeper who is deservedly ranked among the best in the world as their last line of defence. De Gea's mere presence increases United's chances of success - while the \u00a336m move for 19-year-old Monaco striker Antony Martial on transfer deadline day is starting to look like a masterstroke. The world's most expensive teenager has not only scored three goals in three Premier League games, he has demonstrated a natural eye for a finish and the sort of raw pace that will unsettle any defence. Martial's impact looks certain to provide more space and opportunities for Wayne Rooney as an attacking foil - while Van Gaal will also be pleased Memphis Depay got on the scoresheet against Sunderland. So it is too early to say if United can challenge for the title - and realistically the odds are still against with visits to all their serious rivals to come - but there has never been any bad news in being top of the table. Manchester City had every right to complain about officials in their loss at Tottenham, especially when Kyle Walker was yards offside right in front of referee's assistant Simon Beck as Eric Dier equalised seconds before half-time. There was also an offside before Harry Kane scored Spurs' third goal, while visiting manager Manuel Pellegrini could point to a conspiracy of events with goalkeeper Joe Hart and David Silva out through injury and Yaya Toure injured with Spurs leading 2-1. What is of greater concern is the manner of City's capitulation - and also the further evidence that they struggle without the power, leadership and influence of captain Vincent Kompany, who was absent at White Hart Lane because of illness. Pellegrini may have spent more than \u00a360m on central defenders Eliaquim Mangala and Nicolas Otamendi but still no-one comes near to filling the gap left by the 29-year-old Belgian when he is unavailable. He suffered a calf injury before Juventus scored their winner in the Champions League group game at Etihad Stadium and was still missing when they conceded their first goals of the season in their first defeat at home to West Ham. Since Kompany went off against Juve, his side have conceded eight goals in 285 minutes - one every 35.6 minutes - while beforehand they had conceded none in 450 minutes. The stats suddenly make uncomfortable reading for a team that threatened to make the title race a stroll in those opening weeks, with two losses following 11 successive league wins. It is only the second time they have lost successive league games under Pellegrini, while they have conceded more goals in their last two (six) than in their previous 11 combined (four). It was also the first time they have conceded three goals in a single half since 2013 and was their heaviest loss since a 3-0 defeat at Liverpool in April 2011. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has come under increasing pressure and scrutiny as a poor start to the season followed a dismal end to last term that required a review from owners Fenway Sports Group before he was given backing to continue. Two wins from their first six Premier League games and a scraped victory on penalties over League Two Carlisle at Anfield in the League Cup did nothing to ease the sense that Rodgers is only ever one defeat away from a major crisis - especially with two managers of the calibre of Jurgen Klopp and Carlo Ancelotti available and heavily linked with the club. Rodgers faced a defining 10 days before Saturday's meeting with Aston Villa at Anfield, which is followed by a Europa League game against Swiss side Sion and the Merseyside derby at Everton. So it will have come as a huge relief to Rodgers for Liverpool to beat Villa 3-2 - although the manager took the opportunity afterwards to claim there is a mysterious group of people who do not want him at the club. And in Rodgers' most desperate hour of need, he was helped by the return to the goal standard of England striker Daniel Sturridge, making only his second league start of the season after months on the sidelines with injury. Sturridge has helped provide respite for Rodgers, even if it may yet prove temporary, but there is every reason for Liverpool to celebrate the return of the 26-year-old who scored 24 goals in 2013-14. \"Sturridge showed what we missed for over a year - he makes the difference and helps you compete,\" said Rodgers. \"His finishes were brilliant. He's nowhere near 100% fit yet but his two goals were the difference.\" Liverpool's manager has had enough criticism in recent times - so he has every right to enjoy a day when his side returned to winning ways. Some of the Premier League's main marksmen had been suffering a goal drought before Saturday - but the good news for Spurs, Arsenal and Manchester United is that they look to be back in business. Harry Kane, who scored 21 goals in 34 league games last season, had gone more than 12 hours without a goal before he reacted instinctively after a free-kick hit the bar to score Spurs' third in their outstanding win against Manchester City. The barren run of 748 minutes was over. \"There has been a lot of talk but I'm a confident man and have faith in my ability,\" said Kane. \"I'm delighted because this was a very good victory against a team who were top of the table.\" Wayne Rooney was in the worst run of Premier League scoring form since starting his career as a 16-year-old with Everton in August 2002 - but a scoreless run stretching to exactly 1,000 minutes ended when he scored Manchester United's second against Sunderland. It made the stats much more palatable reading, as he became United's joint-third leading league scorer, level with Denis Law on 171. Only Sir Bobby Charlton (199) and Jack Rowley (182) have more. Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez sparked into life in even more spectacular fashion, hitting a treble for his first league goals of the season in the 5-2 win at Leicester City. The Chilean was in magnificent form as he became the first player to score hat-tricks in the Premier League, Serie A and La Liga. \"It took Alexis a while to find his form,\" said Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. \"He didn't come back straight away from the Copa America and after a competition like that it takes some time. Alexis was waiting for a goal - he's not used to not scoring so it was important for him to score.\" And just to add to Wenger's delight, Theo Walcott has slipped under the radar as he builds a reputation as a regular goalscorer. Used more often as a central striker these days, his goal at Leicester was his 12th in his past 13 league games.", "text": ["United", "'s", "3-0", "win", "over", "Sunderland", "saw", "them",

Einstein's greatest predictions will have been directly observed for the first time. If it fails, laws of physics might have to be reconsidered. The experiment is called Advanced Virgo, and it will be hunting for the most elusive of astrophysical phenomena. \"Maybe we have the opportunity for the first time to detect gravitational waves on the Earth,\" explains Dr Franco Frasconi, from the University Pisa, who is part of Virgo's international team. \"This would be a clear demonstration that what Einstein said 100 years ago is absolutely correct.\" On 25 November 1915, Albert Einstein presented the final version of his field equations to the Prussian Academy of Sciences. They underpinned his Theory of General Relativity - a pillar of modern physics that has transformed our understanding of space, time and gravity. From it, we have been able to understand so much - from the expansion of the Universe, to the motion of the planets and the existence of black holes. But he also proposed the presence of gravitational waves, essentially ripples of energy that distort the fabric of space-time. Think of them as a bit like the waves that radiate out when you throw a stone into a pond. Any object with mass should generate them when it's on the move. Even us. But the greater the mass, and more dramatic the motion, the larger the waves. And Einstein predicted that the Universe was awash with them. Ripples in the fabric of space-time But while astronomers have indirect evidence for their existence, getting a glimpse of these cosmic curiosities has not yet been possible. Physicist Dr Toby Wiseman, from Imperial College London, UK, explained: \"I'm not surprised we haven't directly seen gravity waves yet. \"Gravity is actually the most feeble of the forces and even dramatic astrophysical sources only emit weak gravity waves.\" Now, in Italy, scientists hope to find them. But it won't be easy. The first incarnation of the Virgo experiment ran from 2007 - and didn't see anything. Neither did its US-counterpart, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Ligo). But both machines - called interferometers - are now undergoing expensive upgrades, and the teams hope major improvements in sensitivity could hold the key to success. Dr Frasconi explained: \"The technology available to detect gravitational waves is available just today. \"During the last 10 years, we have developed very sophisticated technology to construct this kind of interferometer.\" The scientists are attempting to spot the tiny distortions created when gravitational waves pass through the Earth. They are hoping to see those emanating from violent cosmic events, such as exploding stars or colliding black holes. iWonder: Does Einstein's general theory of relativity still matter? The Virgo detector is formed of two identical 3km-tunnels, in a giant L-shape formation. A laser beam is generated, then split into two - with one half being fired along one tunnel, and the other half surging through the second tunnel. Mirrors at either end send the lasers travelling back and forth many times, before they are recombined. This might seem elaborate, but it takes advantage of a handy property of lasers - the fact that they are intense beams of light, and light is a wave. Imagine if two waves in the ocean crashed into each other, while one was at a peak, and one was at a trough - the waves would cancel each other out. The same is true inside the experiment. And if the waves have travelled exactly the same distance along the two tunnels, then they cancel each other out, producing no signal. However, if a gravitational wave has travelled through the tunnel, it will very subtly distort its surroundings, changing the length of the tunnels by a minute amount - just a fraction of the width of an atom. And the way the waves move through space-time means that one tunnel would be stretched and one squeezed, which would result in one laser travelling a slightly longer distance while the other would have a shorter journey. As a result, the split beams will re-combine in a different way: the waves of light will interfere with each other, rather than cancelling out - and scientists will detect a signal. Great efforts have been made to insulate the experiments from the general rumbles that pervade the Earth, from traffic noise to earthquakes. \"You are trying to a build a machine to avoid potential noise,\" says Dr Frasconi. \"This machine is anchored directly on the ground floor - and the ground floor typically vibrates. The most important challenge is to isolate the mirrors. \"For Virgo, this is the most important challenge. From the beginning we have spent a lot of time to develop the multistage pendulum to isolate the mirrors from seismic noise.\" But even then, a signal in Italy will not be enough. If a gravitational wave is spotted there, the upgraded Advanced Ligo in America, which has the same set-up as Virgo, but is made up of two detectors with 4km-long arms, should also see the signal. So potentially should another, smaller experiment in Germany. Advanced Ligo is now up and running, and scientists hope Virgo will be ready to be switched on by the end of the year. The collaborating teams are so confident of success that they're forecasting that 1 January 2017 will be the day the breakthrough is made. This prediction may be a little tongue in cheek, but Dr Frasconi, who has been working in this field for two decades, is confident that the end of the search is near. \"Right now, it is extremely important to detect for the first time on Earth gravitational waves. Otherwise we do not have the right information, the right knowledge of the rest of the Universe.\" If the waves do not show up now it will mean that the experiments may need to be redesigned. And in the most extreme case, perhaps physicists might have to rethink the way that the Universe works. But a direct glimpse will open a new window on the cosmos - one that wouldn't have been possible without Einstein. Dr Wiseman, from Imperial College London, explains: \"Seeing gravity waves would be fantastic confirmation of our understanding of general relativity. \"We have good reason to think they exist, but we can't be sure we have understood general relativity correctly until we see these ripples in space-time directly. \"Observing them would allow us new ways to test general relativity, but also give us an entirely new tool for observing some of the most fascinating objects in our Universe.\" Follow Rebecca on Twitter", "text": ["If", "it", "'s", "a", "success", ",", "one", "of", "Albert",

distrust and fear has turned it into one of the national game's most divisive issues. Appalled by the horrors of Hillsborough, and ashamed at the state of so many grounds, professional football did not put up much of an argument when Margaret Thatcher's government responded to the tragedy by banning standing areas. Even when this ban was later diluted to just the top two divisions in England and Wales, any nostalgia for football's most famous terraces was crowded out by the bottom line of greater ticket revenues. A consensus soon formed around the idea that all-seater stadia were easier to police, safer and more in line with what modern \"consumers\" wanted - the rising attendances, increased turnover and more diverse fan-base was the proof. So why do nine out of 10 football fans, in almost every survey, say they would like the choice to stand? Why are more clubs wondering if bringing back standing areas could help boost the atmosphere at games, as well as improving relations with those annoyed at being told what they cannot do and struggling to keep up with the game's gentrification? And why are so many experts coming around to the idea that bolting plastic seats to a concrete terrace does not have much impact on a human being's behaviour, or even the likelihood of injury? \"The Hillsborough Independent Panel's report (in 2012) changed everything,\" says Dr Geoff Pearson, an expert on the policing of football crowds at the University of Liverpool. \"In many ways it didn't tell us anything we didn't already know from (Lord Justice) Taylor's 1990 report into the disaster but it confirmed that the reaction to Hillsborough was hijacked to bring in crowd-management and public order measures. \"People were so shocked by the poor quality of most grounds they just didn't think standing could be done safely any more. We now know that's not true. Even Taylor didn't blame terracing.\" The centrality of what happened on 15 April, 1989, to today's debate goes both ways, though. Steve Rotheram, the MP for Liverpool Walton, speaks for many on Merseyside when he says \"safe-standing is an oxymoron\", and suggests those 96 lives would not have been lost if there were seats in the Leppings Lane Stand that day. The emotions are still so raw at Anfield that Liverpool were the only Premier League club to tell a Mail on Sunday survey last month that they could not countenance any move to bring back standing. Rotheram, a Liverpool fan who swapped his Leppings Lane ticket for a seat shortly before kick-off, believes some people romanticise the days when 25,000 fans stood on The Kop - \"grounds are less threatening now\" - and points out that any notion of markedly cheaper tickets for standing sections is fanciful. \"We are not convinced by safe-standing and do not support its introduction \"The rising cost of tickets was something Taylor didn't predict,\" he adds. \"If prices had risen on a par with inflation they'd be \u00a316 now, not \u00a340. \"How much cheaper would a standing ticket be? \u00a35? Working-class fans aren't staying away because they're short of a fiver; they're not coming because they're short of \u00a340.\" Rotheram is right about a return to standing areas not being the panacea to rocketing prices that many yearn for - most British stadia have been designed, or redesigned, with a capacity in mind, and the concourses, exits and gangways cannot accommodate a significant hike in fans. But the cost of tickets is not the only thing Taylor did not see coming. He thought fans would get used to sitting down. \"The people I call the 'carnival fans', those who create most of the atmosphere, have never got used to sitting,\" says Pearson. \"The authorities have simply lost the battle, and blind eyes are being turned around the country every weekend, particularly in away ends.\" Pearson is also right. Many fans cannot understand why clubs below the Championship can legally provide standing areas, and even promoted clubs, such as Yeovil Town, are given two years to go all-seater. If safety is the primary concern, surely this should happen immediately. Then there is the apparent contradiction of allowing fans to stand at horse racing or rugby. This is an anomaly Bristol Sport, the owner of Bristol City FC and Bristol Rugby Club, might be ready to test with its new plans for a renovated Ashton Gate with two standing sections. And finally you have perhaps the most glaring example of the chasm that is growing between the British authorities' view of how football should be consumed, and the way many fans would like to consume it: the Bundesliga. Profitable, successful and suddenly fashionable, the German league has become the Premier League's b\u00eate noire. What it lacks in TV contracts, it compensates with noisy fans, who are closely engaged with their clubs. It is why an estimated 1,000 Brits travel to Dortmund every fortnight to experience the Westfalenstadion's \"Yellow Wall\", the 25,000-capacity southern terrace. Unlike most of the rest of Europe, German clubs resisted the move to all-seaters, and in recent years many of them have upgraded their terraces with \"rail seats\". These are metal seats that can be flipped up, and locked in place, providing space to stand behind a waist-high rail that runs along the back of the row in front. Every \"seat\" is linked to a ticket number, and can be flipped down to meet Uefa rules for European games. Bringing rail seating here has become a crusade for Jon Darch. For the last two years, the Bristol City fan has taken his \"Safe Standing Roadshow\" to grounds around the country. Darch, who admits to being sponsored by a manufacturer of rail seats, says they are \"patently safe\" and \"tick every box\" for any club considering a return to standing. Celtic are just one club Darch has visited, but the Scottish champions have gone one step further than everybody else by formally applying for permission to trial 2,000 rail seats at Celtic Park, with no increase in overall capacity. \"We feel there is a new vibrancy in football that has come from Europe and is now in the UK,\" said Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell in September. \"The safest way to manage that is through safe-standing. These are new systems that are extremely safe, and we are very keen to explore that at Celtic Park.\" With Scottish clubs not being bound by the all-seater requirements of the 1989 Football Spectators Act, and the Scottish Professional Football League dropping its opposition to standing in 2011, hopes had been high that Glasgow City Council's safety advisory group would back Celtic's plan. But a spokesman for the council says talks are \"at an extremely early stage\", and points out \"this would be a major policy shift\". Just how major a shift it would be is clear from the response of perhaps the group's most persuasive voice, Police Scotland. \"We are not convinced by safe-standing and do not support its introduction,\" says assistant chief constable Bernard Higgins. \"If, however, the local authority and safety committee grant permission, we will work with the club and police it accordingly.\" Police opposition is probably the biggest obstacle the safe-standing campaign faces. But even here the picture is blurred. Our view is that seating is generally safer, more comfortable and enables better crowd management The Football Supporters' Federation's safe-standing co-ordinator Peter Daykin says representatives from the Association of Chief Police Officers have told his organisation they were willing to put aside their historic opposition to standing and start a dialogue with fans. According to Daykin, match-day commanders increasingly believe that standing sections could reduce tensions between those fans who want to stand and the stewards tasked with making them sit. \"The objections now tend not to be about safety - we see from Germany, Norway, the US and Leagues One and Two that people stand safely week in, week out - but have moved to standing as the potential cause of crowd disorder,\" he adds. \"We don't believe there is any evidence to link the two, but we've always asked for an evidence-led debate and not a law based on speculation. That's why we want permission to hold a small number of trials in advance of any change in the existing rules.\" But just to emphasise that nothing is simple in this debate, there is even disagreement about how any change to the status quo might happen. The law insists upon all-seater stadia, but it is not against the law for fans not to use those seats; that is a breach of contract between fan and club, based on the ground regulations. Compliance with these regulations is the remit of the Sports Grounds Safety Authority (SGSA), which took on this role when the Football Licensing Authority (FLA) was wound up in 2011. \"The legalities of safe-standing can be debated between solicitors but our understanding is that primary legislation is not required,\" says Daykin. \"The Secretary of State (for Culture, Media and Sport) can direct the SGSA to drop the all-seat requirement from the licence it issues. It's not an outrageous proposal - League One and League Two clubs are already exempt.\" Some hope the abolition of the FLA, which was vehemently against standing, might be the key that unlocks the door to Bundesliga-style terraces. This might prove to be the case in the future - the rhetoric is certainly less dogmatic than it used to be - but for now the regulator's opposition to standing remains. \"We recognise there are some fans who may prefer to stand, and we're happy to engage in an informed and constructive debate, but our view is that seating is generally safer, more comfortable and enables better crowd management,\" says SGSA chief executive Ruth Shaw. \"It can also help to create a more inclusive and diverse environment.\" Shaw's reference to crowd management is interesting given the current focus on stopping fans from bringing pyrotechnics into games, as well as the damage caused by some Celtic fans at Motherwell's Fir Park last weekend. It will be some time before the SGSA, most police and many politicians are convinced that identifying wrongdoers in a standing area is as easy as it is in a seated section, regardless of the improvements in CCTV. So what we are left with is an impasse, with many in football stuck in a No Man's Land between the opposing camps, frightened to move, but scared at being left behind. It is telling that while 19 of 20 Premier League clubs have said they would like to talk about a return to standing, none has raised it at a Premier League shareholders meeting. Even Cardiff City, who have spent most of this year moving persistent standers to the Canton Stand and letting them get on with it, have not tried. The last meeting was a fortnight ago. In the meantime, stewards up and down the land will continue to look for common-sense solutions to the problem of being asked to enforce an unpopular law, and many fans will pay for a seat they do not want.", "text": ["Standing", "up", "to", "watch", "football", "does", "not", "sound", "like", "a", "particularly", "revolutionary", "act", ",", "but", "a", "quarter", "of", "a", "century", "of",

his playing career, though, because Simeone was a magnificent midfielder, winning 106 international caps and starring in Serie A for Inter Milan and Lazio as well as guiding Atletico to a league and cup double in 1996 (their most recent La Liga triumph). And now, Simeone is carving a new career as one of the game's hottest managerial properties, with his approach to coaching mirroring the blend of winning attitude and technical aptitude that characterised his playing days. If you asked Diego Simeone how his Atletico Madrid team have overcome all the odds to progress to the Champions League semi-finals, where they will face Jose Mourinho's Chelsea, as well as topping La Liga with just six games remaining, he would provide you with a simple answer: \"Hard work and humility.\" Indeed, that is exactly the mantra he has been preaching on a weekly basis this season, as the football world continues to wonder when - or if at all - his steamroller of a team will finally run out of puff. Until recently, most people assumed it would simply be a matter of time. When, not if. But Wednesday's famous victory over Barcelona, where Atletico succeeded in knocking the Catalan team out of the Champions League before the last four for the first time since 2007, sent a loud and clear message: Atletico Madrid are for real. To a great extent, Simeone's assessment of his Atletico team's greatest strengths - hard work and humility - is absolutely right. Atletico were only four points above the La Liga relegation zone when Diego Simeone became coach in December 2011. Within 18 months he had guided them to the Europa League, Uefa Super Cup and Copa del Rey titles. The discipline, intensity and sheer, uncompromising effort of their play is unrivalled. That was never more evident in the opening stages on Wednesday, when Atletico's whirlwind of attacking pressure simply blew Barcelona away, resulting in Koke netting the only goal of the game and David Villa thumping shots against the woodwork twice inside the opening 20 minutes. Hard work and humility - as well as, to use Simeone's other favourite phrase, going from game to game - have allowed Atletico's bunch of largely unheralded journeymen, none of whom (with the exception of Villa) were superstars before they arrived at the Vicente Calderon, to barge their way without an invitation into the upper echelons of world football. For any football fan who has become cynical about the modern game's tendency to be ruled by huge dollops of money, Atletico's unstoppable rise has been a breath of fresh air. In the days of Arab sheikhs, Russian oligarchs and American business tycoons, low-budget teams like Atletico simply aren't supposed to do this well. Yet here they are, with less than six weeks of the season remaining, still in strong contention for the two most prestigious prizes on offer. That is, indeed, largely down to the relentless work ethic instilled by Simeone. But it would be very wrong to suggest that Atletico's current success is simply down to the fact that they run around a lot, because there is also a huge amount of quality and intelligence within their ranks. That starts on the training ground, where Simeone and his gruff assistant Mono Burgos prepare the perfect tactics to suit their team's strengths. Under Simeone's instruction, Atletico are defensively disciplined, unsurpassably organised and play with great game awareness, knowing when to press ferociously in numbers and when to sit deep, waiting for the right opportunity to pounce upon their hapless opponents and launch a rapid, pinpoint counter-attack. As the eloquent Argentine boss explained in the build-up to his team's latest triumph, Barcelona's strength lies in controlling possession; Atletico's lies in controlling space. Simeone's attention to detail and his ability to clearly communicate his plans ensures that his players have mastered the art of playing the game where they want to, while simultaneously forcing their opponents into areas where they feel uncomfortable. More than anything, though, Simeone's unbounding positivity and unshakeable belief that good habits, when consistently applied on a day to day basis, will lead to winning performances has succeeded in completely turning Atletico's image on its head. For years, Madrid's second team suffered from a severe inferiority complex as neighbouring Real ruled the roost and the rest of Spain derided them as hapless bunglers who always managed to somehow mess everything up. That reputation was most famously captured in a notorious television advert, when a forlorn young boy asked his frowning father: \"Porque somos del Atleti?\" Why are we Atleti fans? It was a sort of Spanish equivalent to \"Accrington Stanley\u2026who are dey?\" and illustrated the inescapable sense of inevitable doom which habitually engulfed Atletico fans as they lurched from disaster to disaster. Under Simeone, Atletico are finally shattering that conception; their manager is even an image of vibrant self-belief as he prowls the touchline during games, constantly turning to the crowd and vigorously urging them to applaud the players for their wholehearted effort. When referee Howard Webb blew the final whistle at the Vicente Calderon on Wednesday, tremendous scenes of jubilation were unleashed, with the home fans - chanting and singing with a relentlessness almost matching their team - refusing to leave the shaking stadium until their heroes re-emerged from the tunnel to embark upon a celebratory lap of honour. As the players finally gave way to those demands and dragged their weary bodies back onto the pitch, to be sportingly saluted even by the travelling Barcelona fans, one man was conspicuous by his absence. Diego Simeone was apparently nowhere to be seen. But he was there all right, hiding on his own at the back of the dugout, quietly watching the scenes of celebration he had helped to create with obvious pride, seemingly struggling to force back tears. After the hard work, the humility. Former Liverpool and Republic of Ireland forward Michael Robinson, who finished his playing career in Spain and is now the country's foremost television pundit, concluded his rhapsody over Atletico's performance by enthusing: \"It's impossible not to admire them.\" Robinson is exactly right. \"Why are we Atletico fans?\" Right now, the more pertinent question is why anyone wouldn't be.", "text":

something from the Matrix science-fiction movies. But what they reveal is that more people are renting homes than buying, more households have cars, and there are more people who have never been married. They also suggest people are becoming more educated, with more getting degrees or similarly high levels of education. Home ownership - either with a mortgage or loan, or outright - has decreased since 2001, when the previous census was conducted, currently standing at 14.7 million households, down from 14.9 million. And the proportion of people renting from a private landlord or letting agency increased from 9% (1.9 million) in 2001 to 15% (3.6 million) in 2011. Chris Norris, of the National Landlords Association, says: \"There has been a huge shift in the make-up of the UK housing market. \"Social housing provision is in decline and access to mortgage finance has become increasingly difficult for a large proportion of households, particularly in the south-west of England, contributing to unprecedented demand for good quality rental property. \"Fifteen years ago private renting was synonymous with specific types of predominantly young households. \"Today, more and more families are finding their housing needs are best met by private landlords.\" What about sharing your home with a husband or wife? Not easy, according to these statistics, as the proportion of people who have never married has risen from 30% (12.5 million) to 35% (15.7 million). Mary Balfour, of the Drawing Down The Moon introduction agency, says it is \"much more difficult\" than ever before to meet people. \"People stay at home more than ever, as with so much technology around they don't need to go out,\" she says. \"Pubs are closing, and people can't always afford to socialise, and lifestyles have changed. \"These days there are many online sites where you can meet a partner, but people get put off because they don't know how to manage it. \"Also, a lot of people lie about themselves online - not out of any malicious intent, but through wishing to appear more attractive.\" The number of cars and vans available for use by households in England and Wales increased from 23.9 million to 27.3 million between 2001 and 2011. In 2001 there were, on average, 11 cars per 10 households, while in 2011 there were 12. Prof Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, says these figure are unsurprising. \"Our own work shows car and van ownership has spread across the social spectrum and the biggest growth is amongst those on the lowest incomes,\" he says. \"The bigger question is not how many people have access to a vehicle but how many miles are they doing in them. \"The recession has knocked back the volume of traffic - but prior to the economic downturn, private car use was essentially rising across all areas of the country except London, led by a surge in female drivers.\" Attitude shift In 2011 there were 12.4 million people (27%) educated to degree level or above. In 2001, that figure stood at 7.4 million. Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK, says that, in the UK, occupations requiring a degree will continue to grow over the next decade. \"Over this census period, the increase in degree-level qualifications has been driven by demand from employers and also by people recognising the long-term benefits of gaining a degree. \"The kinds of skills that higher education provides - the ability to think critically and to analyse and present evidence - are going to be increasingly in demand as our economy continues to shift.\" Education is spreading, then, but what about faith? How tight is the nation's grip on its religious convictions? All religions, except for Christianity, have increased in popularity from 2001, with Muslims going up by two percentage points to 1.5 million. The number of Christians decreased to 33.2 million in 2011 from 37.3 million in 2001. And the proportion of people with no religious affiliation increased from 15% (7.7 million) to 25% (14.1 million). Terry Sanderson, president of the National Secular Society, says the fall in the number of Christians showed a \"huge upheaval\" in attitudes towards religion. \"It should serve as a warning to the church that their increasingly conservative attitudes are not playing well with the public at large,\" he says. But Nick Spencer, research director at Theos, the public theology think tank, says: \"These figures show that we have a plural religious landscape, but that doesn't mean we're atheists. \"Digging deeper, we see that even those who say they have no religion often have a variety of spiritual beliefs, but they don't want to associate these to religious institutions.\" Mr Spencer also says religion is \"difficult to define and difficult to measure\" - not unlike the feat of recording the lives of people in England and Wales.", "text": ["Rows", "and", "rows", "of", "numbers", ",",

has appeared for the first time on the UK Kennel Club's list of vulnerable breeds. Figures show a two thirds drop in puppy registrations in the last decade. The Chihuahua, popularised by celebrity owners like Paris Hilton, saw a 25% increase in registrations last year. But the celebrity effect appears to have been positive for one native breed - the Cardigan Welsh corgi, whose skyrocketing numbers have been ascribed to links with the Queen and the Royal Wedding. Caroline Kisko, secretary of the Kennel Club said: \"Celebrities, popular culture and fashion play a big part in today's society and unfortunately, dogs are not immune from our fickle tastes. \"The latest victim is the English setter, a wonderful and loyal breed, while the number of Siberian huskies has more than trebled in this country in the last 10 years.\" Fran Grimsdell from Norfolk, who breeds English setters, told BBC News: \"The thing that saddens me is that we're getting people buying puppies, but they're nearly all people who have already owned English setters. \"English setters have got a fantastic nature... I would say that they are sensitive, terribly affectionate, loyal and wonderfully elegant in appearance. They are good with children. They can be a bit wilful... but I love that.\" Thought to be one of the oldest native breeds, the setter's history stretches back at least 200 years to dogs used for hunting upland game birds. The medium-sized breed - with its characteristic flecked coat - is regarded as a good family pet, but also requires a large home and lots of exercise. With 234 registrations last year, the setter joins 24 other dogs considered to be at risk of extinction on the club's list of Native Vulnerable Breeds. British and Irish breeds are added when puppy registrations drop below 300 in a year. In 2011, some 3,000 dogs were registered across the 25 vulnerable breeds. Chihuahuas, meanwhile, saw more than 6,000 registrations. Percentage change on 2010 Arguably the most endangered breed of all is the otterhound, a large rough-coated dog with a loud, baying call. There were just 38 otterhound registrations last year (a decline of 33% on 2010). Pam Marston-Pollock, chair of the UK Otterhound Club, said there were now just three breeders in the UK. An estimated 600 of the dogs remain worldwide, but only a fraction of these are suitable for breeding. \"As far as the show world is concerned, we don't have many younger people involved with the breed. The established breeders who have been around for 30 years are either dying off or aren't keeping as many hounds,\" Ms Marston-Pollock told BBC News. \"It's a sign of the times generally that keeping substantially sized hounds is quite expensive.\" She added: \"We're obviously conscious that we've got a narrow gene pool... we've had a meeting to discuss the possibility of bringing in an outcross with another breed to broaden our gene pool.\" 7 questions on dog breeds Such approaches have been successful in the case of Dalmatians, which can be prone to kidney or bladder stones. By outbreeding with a pointer, one Dalmatian breeder was able to remove the trait responsible. Other vulnerable native dogs include the Dandie Dinmont terrier (98 registrations, down 35% on 2010) and the Skye terrier (44 registrations in 2011, up 19% on the previous year). The Skye terrier was immortalised in the story of Greyfriars Bobby, the 19th Century Edinburgh dog that guarded the grave of its former owner for 14 years. Breeders say parts of the country's heritage will be lost if native breeds are left to die out. Ms Kisko said the needs of exotic breeds were poorly understood by many owners. As a result, she said, the Kennel Club had seen an increase in the number of exotic dogs coming in to breed rescue societies when owners realise they are unable to give them the exercise, grooming or other care that they need. One example is the Afghan hound, which requires about two hours exercise per day and daily grooming. In 2009-2010, 43% of all Afghan hounds registered with the Kennel Club ended up in breed rescue centres. The impact of celebrity may have had a positive effect on at least one native vulnerable breed, the Cardigan Welsh corgi. Registrations shot up by 134% in 2011. This has been put down to the \"Royal Wedding effect\" and the breed's close relationship with the Pembroke Welsh corgi, owned by the Queen. Harvey Locke, a former president of the British Veterinary Association (BVA) told BBC News: \"There are more than 200 pedigree dogs... we want to do everything we can to encourage responsible dog breeding. \"We are obviously against unscrupulous ones who breed only for profit. Everybody suffers there: the people who buy the puppies suffer and the dogs suffer.\" He urged some breeders to move away from selecting for extreme features and called on prospective dog owners to seek advice from veterinary surgeons.

going on in the economy? Probably not. \"In the past, the ONS's early GDP estimates have contained no statistically useful information about growth.\" Did these views, quoted in a blog by Stephanie Flanders, the BBC's former economics editor, come from some extreme outlier in the economic world? No, they came from Ben Broadbent, who was an economist at Goldman Sachs at the time and who is now deputy governor of the Bank of England and a member of its interest rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee. GDP is a measure of all of the goods and services produced by an economy over a particular period, usually three months. His comments were based on research by his colleague Kevin Daly, who is still at Goldman Sachs and is not a fan of the figures. \"We didn't believe the data in 2009,\" he says. The economy was recovering much more slowly than other economies, but other indicators didn't agree. In particular, the employment data was difficult to reconcile with other data.\" Mr Daly says there is much less debate about the period now, and that ONS reviews have agreed with his analysis. ONS chief economist Joe Grice sees things a bit differently. \"In the second half of 2009, lots of commentators were saying that the economy was growing fast, but it's clear now that it wasn't,\" he says. He adds that it's a good thing the Bank of England did not believe the people who said there was a lot of growth, because then it might have raised interest rates and \"we would have been in terrible trouble by now\". How GDP became the figure to watch There is no question that there are uncertainties surrounding the first estimate of UK growth measured by gross domestic product (GDP), as Joe Grice explained last year. The first figures come less than a month after the end of the period they're measuring, which is pretty swift by international standards. At that point only about 44% of the returns from businesses have been received. \"Only the US does it so early - the rest of Europe does it 15 days later,\" says James Mitchell, professor of economic modelling at Warwick Business School. \"Revisions are inevitable because we put pressure on the ONS to produce estimates so early.\" GDP estimates are indeed constantly being revised, most formally one month and two months later, but they never stop being revised, mainly because of changes to the methodology. When there are big changes to the methodology, like the ones due later this year that will change the treatment of spending on research and development for example, the changes have to be backdated, so there are likely to be revisions to some pretty old figures. So, with how much of a pinch of salt should the preliminary estimate be taken? Joe Grice says plus or minus 0.2 percentage points would be fair. What that means, as with most economic data, is that what is important is the trend rather than the precise figure. This was a particular problem in 2011 and 2012 when there were several quarters of growth or contraction of 0.2% or less. You may remember the double-dip recession that disappeared after the figure for the first quarter of 2012 was revised. It's important to bear in mind just how difficult it is to measure GDP for an advanced economy. Jonathan Haskel, professor of economics at Imperial College Business School, explains part of the problem with the example of an economy producing steel and cars. You can't just count all the sales by the steel company and the car companies because some of the steel has gone into the cars, so you need to avoid counting it twice. Instead you have to count the value added at each stage of the process. \"In the face of a difficult task the ONS is probably doing the best it can,\" says Prof Haskel. \"It's probably not doing it any worse than anyone else.\" And the task is being made more difficult. \"The economy is changing in ways not captured well by the statistics,\" says Diane Coyle, author of GDP: A brief but affectionate history. She cites the increasing numbers of small firms and the importance of things like software and trademarks. \"We need to take the quarterly figures more cautiously than we do,\" she says. She adds that the ONS is better than most at calculating the figures. Respected economist and former Bank of England committee member Kate Barker will soon publish her review of the quality of ONS figures, so we will soon get another assessment of their quality. It should be said that the ONS is generally judged to have captured the sharp declines in GDP as a result of the financial crisis pretty well, which improved many commentators' views of its methodology. Also, few would argue against the idea that bodies such as the MPC need to use official figures from the ONS alongside things like business surveys, which may give more immediate ideas of the state of the economy as well as hinting at what may happen in the future. Indeed, the Bank of England is unusual in producing its own indicator called the GDP backcast, which combines the ONS figures with other factors. Nonetheless, its official position is that the Monetary Policy Committee puts considerable weight on the ONS data and understands that it needs revising for honourable reasons from time to time. And Ben Broadbent hasn't objected to that so far.", "text": ["Take", "these", "comments", "as", "an", "example", ",", "from", "23", "October", "2009", ".", "``", "Do", "today", "'s", "data", "tell",

The report???s lead author Prof Georgina Mace said: ???This problem is not just about to come??? it???s here already.\" She told BBC News: \"We have to get the mindset that with climate change and population increase we are living in an ever-changing world ??? and we need much better planning if we hope to cope.\" The report says governments have not grasped the risk of booming populations in coastal cities as sea level rises and extreme events become more severe. ???People are increasingly living in the wrong places, and it's likely that extreme events will be more common,\" Prof Mace says. ???For most hazards, population increase contributes at least as much as climate change - sometimes more. We are making ourselves more vulnerable whilst making the climate more extreme. ???It is impossible for us to avoid the worst and most unexpected events. But it is not impossible to be prepared for an ever-changing world. We must organise ourselves right away.\" The report???s team said the UK was comparatively resilient to extreme events ??? but still vulnerable because of the high density of people living in areas at risk. The report advises all levels of society to prepare ??? from strategic planning at an international and national level to local schemes by citizens to tackle floods or heatwaves. Its scenarios are based on the assumption that the world stays on the current trajectory of emissions, which the authors assume will increase temperature by 2.6-4.8C around 2090. It assumes a population of nine billion. They say they have built upon earlier work by calculating the effects of climate change coupled with population trends. They warn that the effects of extremes will be exacerbated by the increase in elderly people, who are least able to cope with hot weather. Urbanisation will make the issue worse by creating ???heat islands??? where roads and buildings absorb heat from the sun. As well as building homes insulated against the cold, we must also ensure they can be properly ventilated in the summer, the report says. The authors say cutting greenhouse gas emissions is essential. But they argue that governments will also need to adapt to future climatic shifts driven by climate change. They suggest threats could be tackled through a dual approach. The simplest and cheapest way of tempering heatwaves, they say, is to maintain existing green space. Other low-cost options are planting new trees, encouraging green roofs, or painting roofs white to reflect the sun. The authors say air conditioners are the most effective way of keeping cool ??? but they are costly, they dump heat into city streets and their use exacerbates climate change. Flooding is another priority area, the report says. It finds that large-scale engineering solutions like sea walls offer the most effective protection to coastal flooding - but they are expensive, and when they fail the results can be disastrous. The ideal solution, the authors think, may be a combination of ???hard??? engineering solutions like dykes matched with ???soft??? solutions like protecting wetlands to hold water and allow it to seep into the ground. A scheme at Pickering in Yorkshire previously featured by BBC News is held as an example. The report concludes more research is needed to measure the effectiveness of these ecosystem solutions. It insists that governments should carefully prioritise their spending. They should protect major infrastructure like electricity generation because of its knock-on effect on the broader economy. They should expect some lower-priority defences to fail from time to time, then work to minimise the consequences of that failure . The authors identify excess heat as another potential threat to economies and agriculture if temperatures climb too high for outdoor workers. They examine projected rises in the ???wet bulb??? index used by the US Army and others to measure the temperature felt when the skin is wet and exposed to moving air. Some areas may experience many weeks when outdoor activity is heavily restricted, they fear ??? although the trend of agricultural labour loss may be offset through the century as more and more people move to cities. It puts a figure on those at greatest overall risk: populations in poor countries make up only 11% of those exposed to hazards but account for 53% of the disaster deaths. Some economists argue this shows that poor nations should increase their economies by burning cheap fossil fuels because that will allow them to spend more later on disaster protection. The authors also call for reform of the financial system to take into account the exposure of assets to extreme events. They say: ???Unless risks are accurately evaluated and reported, companies will have limited incentives to reduce them. And valuations and investment decisions will continue to be poorly informed.??? One author, Rowan Douglas, from the Willis Research Network, said he suspected this might be the most significant contribution of the report. The authors want organisations to report their maximum probable losses due to extreme events, based on a 1% chance of the event on any given year. ???The 1% stress test is not as extreme as it might sound ??? it implies a 10% chance of an organization being affected once a decade,??? they say. They say decisions made over the next few decades as the world builds vast urban areas will be key to the resilience of people by the end of the century.

small and there weren't a lot of jobs,\" he remembers. \"Just a few for installation.\" But the Chinese government had big ambitions to expand solar and Moser saw his chance. He spent some years accumulating knowledge about the Chinese solar industry, before co-founding Symtech Solar, which designs solar panel systems using Chinese parts. The idea is to make it easy for organisations outside China to access components without the hassle of having to source and assemble lots of different parts. \"You don't want to buy a car door or a car engine, you want to buy a car,\" he explains. Symtech now has a portfolio of small projects dotted around the world and it is hoping to increase installations in the Middle East, thanks to a new office in Oman. Moser isn't the only US entrepreneur who turned to China. Alex Shoer, of Seeder, helped to launch a business that brings solar panels to the roofs of buildings within the country. He deals with foreign businesses who, say, want to make their Beijing office a little greener. The firm says it has so far erected three megawatts' worth of solar installations, with another 28 megawatts on the way for various clients. \"We will source the capital to finance, pay for the whole project and then sell the power at a discount,\" Shoer says. Again, the model relies on sourcing the right parts at a favourable cost. These kind of installations are known as \"distributed generation\" projects, in which electricity is produced on a small scale, at or very near to a specific point of consumption. Within China, distributed generation is growing at an extraordinary rate, driven in large part by farmers who use the panels to power agricultural equipment that might not be connected to the grid. Shoer comments that he was attracted by Beijing's commitment to the solar industry. For years it has encouraged local authorities to do what they can to boost production, research and development. China's rapid expansion of renewable energy facilities has since caught headlines around the world. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the country installed more than 34 gigawatts of solar capacity in 2016 - more than double the figure for the US and nearly half of the total added capacity worldwide that year. Early figures for 2017 show China has added another eight gigawatts in the first quarter alone. \"It's a huge market,\" says Heymi Bahar at the IEA. Most of the world's solar cells are made in China and Taiwan, he adds - more than 60%. The impressive scale doesn't stop there. The largest solar farm in the world - Longyangxia Dam Solar Park, all 30sq km of it - is a Chinese project. And the country recently opened the world's largest floating solar farm, in Huainan, Anhui Province. It has been constructed over an old coal mine, which over the years had filled with rainwater. Sungrow, the Chinese firm that designed the solar plant, says its system automatically monitors current and voltage generated by the cells, along with humidity, which can affect their efficiency. Because of the abundant water nearby, cleaning the panels - an endless task for solar farmers - will be easier, according to those behind the facility. These mega projects have become possible, and indeed more common, thanks to the rapidly falling cost of solar cells. \"What we were all hoping for 20 years ago when the idea of cheap solar was just a dream, was that someone would come into this on an industrial scale and drive down the cost,\" recalls Charles Donovan, at Imperial College Business School. \"That is exactly what China has done.\" But today, solar energy production accounts for just 1% of China's total energy demand. A huge 66% of demand still comes from coal, something that the country's National Energy Administration wants to change drastically by 2050 - not least because of China's well-known air pollution problems. But by that key date of 2050, a very different mix of energies could be powering China, should some projections become reality. One government report even suggested that renewables could supply 86% of the country's energy needs, with solar providing around a third of that. Can China do it? According to one expert observer, the answer is, \"maybe\". \"What China is trying to do is rationalise a very large, fast growing system,\" explains Jeffrey Ball at Stanford University's Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance. Ball is the lead author of a recent report that details China's success as an innovator in the solar panel industry. But as Ball points out, the revolution has not been without teething issues. For one thing, Chinese subsidies, which some argue are unsustainable, have not always been smoothly administered. The \"feed-in tariff\", for example, often offered to solar companies that generate electricity, has sometimes been paid late. \"The government is often a year or more late in delivering that revenue - that wreaks havoc with the financials on a project,\" says Ball. The value of subsidies has recently been cut, too. What's more, China's large solar farms are largely in less densely populated areas in the west of the country, far from population centres like Beijing or Shanghai, in the east. Building extra grid capacity to transfer it is time-consuming and expensive. This leads to a problem known as curtailment - a solar farm produces, say, 20 megawatts of electricity but can only find buyers for 15 megawatts. \"Depending on who you talk to in the provinces that have by far the largest amount of solar production, curtailment rates are 30% and in some cases significantly higher than 30% - that's extraordinary and that's a real problem,\" explains Ball. Whether China can achieve its lofty ambitions for renewable energy remains to be seen - but it has certainly proved its ability to foster a world-leading solar industry. For US entrepreneurs like Geof Moser, that's enough to propel his own business towards further growth for now. \"The reality is that renewable energy is very cheap - especially solar energy,\" he says. \"And the reason is China.\"", "text": ["So", "he", "headed", "for", "China", ".", "``", "The", "solar", "industry", "was", "fairly", "small", "and", "there", "were", "n't", "a", "lot", "of",

than a democratic ballot, but the dramatic arrest of Fifa officials in their hotel rooms cast a dark cloud over proceedings. Suspicion has hung about Fifa for years, and although Mr Blatter is not thought to be implicated in Wednesday's arrests, one has to wonder - why is he so determined to carry on in the top job? Mr Blatter was re-elected for an unprecedented fifth four-year term, and in doing so remains in charge of a multibillion-dollar sport. What drives a man, soon to be 80, and who once promised not to stand for re-election, to so clearly crave another four years in such a high profile, and highly scrutinised, position? \"He clearly considers himself to be the only person capable of running Fifa,\" says Roland Buechel, a Swiss member of parliament and campaigner for more transparency at the top of football. \"I assume he wants to die in office\". Mr Blatter was born to a modest family in the alpine town of Visp. Legend has it he was the king of the playground at the local primary school in the 1940s, and the only boy there who possessed a professional-quality football. After school Mr Blatter followed a not unusual career pattern for a Swiss man in the 1960s and 70s. He did his obligatory service in Switzerland's militia army, rising to the rank of colonel. While there he made contacts which would serve him later in life. Mr Blatter worked in the watch industry, and increasingly in sports management, serving at the Swiss Ice Hockey Federation before moving to Fifa as its technical director in 1975. When he was first elected as Fifa president in 1998 there was, Mr Buechel remembers, a certain amount of national celebration in Mr Blatter's home country. \"We were proud to have a Swiss person in charge of such an important international organisation,\" he says. In Visp, Mr Blatter's old school was renamed after him. His portrait hangs in the hall and sports days regularly bear his name. He continues to receive a warm welcome when he visits the town. \"He's very uncomplicated, very approachable,\" says Hans-Peter Berchtold, sports editor of the local newspaper Walliserbote. Nevertheless, Mr Berchtold admits that when it comes to the allegations of corruption at Fifa, even Mr Blatter's oldest acquaintances are \"not blind\". \"Everyone knows there are problems at Fifa,\" he says. \"But they don't think Sepp Blatter should be made responsible for all of them.\" Mr Berchtold argues that there are plenty of positive aspects to the Fifa president's record, among them promoting football in developing countries, successfully staging Africa's first-ever World Cup, and, more recently, committing Fifa to a process of reform. But that is precisely where some of Mr Blatter's critics disagree. \"He has had 17 years to improve governance at Fifa,\" says Eric Martin, head of the Swiss branch of the anti-corruption NGO Transparency International. \"I'm sceptical whether he will ever do it now.\" In 2011 an independent panel convened by Fifa proposed a package of reforms. Fifa's decision to ignore its recommendations for fixed terms, age limits, and full disclosure of cash, was criticised by Transparency International. \"In Switzerland we change our president every year,\" says Eric Martin, head of the anti-corruption body's Swiss branch. \"I'm sure Fifa could do the same after 17 years.\" And while some old friends describe him as down-to-earth and open, others who have worked with him say he resents opposition, pointing to the swift departure of Fifa colleagues who dared to question him. Mr Blatter bluntly turned down a suggestion of a television debate with candidates standing against him. When asked once about his reaction to criticism of his stewardship of Fifa, the loudest of which has come from media in World Cup heavyweights Germany and England, Mr Blatter replied, somewhat ominously, that he could \"forgive, but not forget\". Many in Switzerland wonder how Mr Blatter can have been in charge of Fifa for so long, amid so many reports of corruption, and yet remain apparently untouched. One Swiss newspaper jokingly called him \"the dark prince of football, the godfather, Don Blatterone\" - but no inquiry has ever revealed proof of his involvement in bribery. \"He's a survivor,\" says Mr Buechel. \"Nothing ever sticks to him, there is always someone between him and the bribes.\" \"I can tell you for sure he is not bribable,\" counters Hans-Peter Berchtold. \"Money is not what motivates him.\" What emerges then, finally, is a man who both critics and supporters say cannot imagine his life without Fifa. His career there has outlasted three marriages. Mr Buechel and Mr Martin believe that Mr Blatter's determination to hold on to his post is now damaging football's governing body by not allowing space for successors to emerge. Even fans like Mr Berchtold express regret that Mr Blatter did not accept the time was right to leave. \"He could have had a nice retirement here in Visp,\" he says. \"He had the chance now to leave by the front entrance.\" Now Mr Berchtold fears that \"if something bad at Fifa happens\" over the next four years, an octogenarian Mr Blatter could be bundled unceremoniously out the back door - not a nice ending for the boy who kicked a football round Visp schoolyard. Perhaps Fifa is Sepp Blatter's playground now and he still wants to be king.

reform or quit - was about the behaviour of ministers right now before any reforms have been negotiated, rather than in a future referendum on the UK's membership of Europe, leads to some worrying conclusions. One possibility is that this was at the forefront of his mind - that he was reflecting on a huge internal row that we know nothing about. I've seen it before - the public words only make sense when we read the private memoirs many years later. It is possible, with a dash of that generosity - and a couple of handfuls of vivid imagination - to imagine some cabinet ministers are telling the prime minister his renegotiation is pointless and they want to shout from the rooftops that Britain should leave the EU come what may, even before he has started talks. If this is the case, and they aren't even willing to pay lip service to his plan, even for a few short months, then he would have every right to demand they should exit from his presence forthwith. It is hard to see how any minister could have the extraordinary temerity to demand to stay on the inside, while playfully soaking the tent. So if that is why Mr Cameron interpreted the questions in such an odd way then he is in a whole world of pain, and the government is on the verge of revolt and disintegration. If it is not the case, but Mr Cameron did genuinely misunderstand the clear point of the journalists' questions, then it is worrying that he is allowed anywhere near vital negotiations involving simple comprehension, or indeed putting nouns and verbs in the proper order. To misunderstand the point of the inquiries you would have to be, to use a technical political term, a bit thick. But most observers do not presume the PM is either daft or facing an imminent revolt. They assume he meant what he said at the time, and subsequently had his spokeswoman row back at a rate of knots because he came under a lot of pressure from ministers who want to leave their options open when negotiations are concluded. On one obvious level this is dangerous politics. Shooting the messenger is all very well - gunning down the men and women who cover politics day in and day out, leaving them wounded, aggrieved, and distrustful is not smart. But it is wise of Mr Cameron not to box himself in. He is a master tactician unburdened by too much strategy, and will need plenty of wiggle room in the future, to work out which option is less likely to make his supporters squirm. Whether or not to allow ministers the right to campaign either for an \"In\" or \"Out\" in a referendum will be a profound decision. It implies the lesser, but still important, question of whether there will be a single, official Conservative Party position - a near impossibility, I think. There won't be a good decision for Mr Cameron - only a less bad one. Much will depend on the political realities at the time. From Mr Cameron's point of view, there is obviously great merit in having a government position, presumably for a 'yes' vote and demanding loyalty from ministers. It gives the country a firm and decisive message. But if he insists on a facade of unity the risk is that it will fracture. It almost certainly would to an extent. The question is how big the cracks would be. There is a range from the terminally damaging - half the cabinet resigning - to the negligible (the junior minister for spoons going off in a huff and having his five minutes of glory on the Today programme). The reality is likely to be somewhere in between. While there are attractions for Mr Cameron in showing a liberality of spirit and allowing ministers to follow their inner instincts, there is a risk that a herd of them will head off to the \"No\" campaign, knowing there will be no penalty for undermining their leader and making the government look chaotic and split. It doesn't take much to turn that from a matter of consciousness to a leadership challenge to a man you have judged to be selling a duff deal. It is worth noting Boris Johnson has suggested it would be \"safer and more harmonious\" to allow minsters to campaign as they wish. On the other hand if cabinet ministers who are well known sceptics, like the Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, do declare that they will back the UK staying in the EU that would be a powerful boost for the prime minister's case. This is all being watched with extreme frustration across the continent. Many in Westminster are misjudging the position of Mr Cameron's European allies. Mrs Merkel's emollience and genuine alarm at the idea of the UK leaving the EU should not be taken for tolerance of the British debate. The view is that Mr Cameron has no real burning desire to reshape Britain's relationship with the Union, but that he has got himself into a profound pickle trying to soothe his insatiable and fractious party. They are wearily willing to lend a hand to pull him out of a morass of his own making, but don't expect to be lectured in the process. The level of distress the continuing debate causes within the government is important for all of us. Dealing with such a profoundly important question as the UK's future destiny is exhausting. Sitting on a tiny majority and keeping together a party that is well versed in civil war is nerve-wracking. The prime minister and chancellor may have boundless skill and enthusiasm, but they are only human. Scaling twin peaks of such magnitude may not leave them with a great deal of time and energy to focus on bread-and-butter issues. It is uncomfortable being a passenger in a vehicle where there is an argument over which way to go, more so if someone is actually trying to grab the steering wheel. The prime minister has a nearly impossible job. It is not just that his party is split on Europe - it is more that it isn't. \"We will legislate in the first session of the next Parliament for an in-out referendum to be held on Britain's membership of the EU before the end of 2017. We will negotiate a new settlement for Britain in the EU. And then we will ask the British people whether they want to stay in on this basis, or leave. We will honour the result of the referendum, whatever the outcome.\" A majority in the Conservative Party have a widespread contempt for the European Union. They will take some convincing to temper that, and argue Mr Cameron has changed the world. Nevertheless, some Conservatives, including, I would guess, the prime minister and chancellor, feel that on balance it is in the national interest to stay part of the club, at least after a few cosmetic tweaks. The strength of belief on the other side is deeper, and more passionate, if just as hard-headed about what is in the national interest. It makes the tone of debate difficult, and the risk to the Conservative Party serious. It may be easier for a self-declared two-term prime minister to choose country over party but it will be a dangerous moment. It is always difficult when a country's leader has to choose between perceived national interest and party unity, and it is unsurprising Mr Cameron has chosen to look muddled now rather than face a revolt before talks have even begun.", "text": ["But", "accepting", "that", "his", "briefing", "to", "journalists", "at", "the", "G7", "-", "at", "which", "he", "was", "reported", "as", "saying",

tea packets. That is not the reality for most tea workers. Last year, I was part of a BBC team that revealed the appalling conditions for workers and their families on estates that grow tea for some of the biggest brands in the world. Our findings in the Indian state of Assam prompted the companies that own Tetley's, Twinings, Liptons, PG Tips and Yorkshire Tea to say they would work to improve conditions on the estates they buy from in India. But this week, the World Bank confirmed standards in the industry remain dire. It published a report on the second biggest tea producer in India, a company almost 50% controlled by Tata, the giant Indian multinational that owns the Tetley Tea brand. The report says low wages and poor living and working conditions for the 155,000 people who live on the vast estates owned by Amalgamated Plantations Private Limited (APPL) are leading to high levels of malnutrition and ill health. That is exactly what we found on the estates we visited last year. Plantation owners in India are obliged by law to provide and maintain adequate houses and sanitary toilets for workers, yet we found tea workers living in homes with leaking roofs and terrible sanitation. Many families had no toilets and said they had no choice but to defecate among the tea bushes. We found living and working conditions so bad, and wages so low, that tea workers and their families were left malnourished and vulnerable to fatal illnesses. The joint investigation by BBC News and BBC Radio 4's File on Four programme also found a shocking disregard for health and safety, with workers spraying chemicals without protection, and on some estates, children working alongside adults. This week's World Bank report was a damning indictment of the efforts of its own subsidiary, International Finance Corporation (IFC), to improve living standards for tea workers. Through the IFC, the World Bank invested $7.8m (\u00c2\u00a36.3m) to take a 20% stake in APPL back in 2009. The idea was to support an attempt to make tea workers part-owners of the estates where they work, in an effort to preserve jobs and raise standards in the industry. But according to the findings of a two-year investigation by the internal auditor that holds the World Bank Group accountable to its own policies, the IFC has failed on almost every count. The investigation found that the bank had failed \"to respond systematically to issues regarding housing and living conditions\" or to correct serious lapses in the use of pesticides, \"with the result that workers have been exposed to extremely hazardous chemicals\". It said that low wages contributed to workers' acute malnutrition and exposure to disease, quoting a 2014 report commissioned by Tata that found daily wages at the time so low that workers were unable to afford basic nutritional requirements. It found that provision of healthcare and education was inadequate, and workers' rights to unionise and air their grievances were not met. The investigation also concluded that the World Bank had not done enough to ensure child labour was not being used, nor had it responded adequately to workers' complaints that they were being pushed into the share ownership scheme. \"The report validates concerns workers have been raising for years about poor living and working conditions on APPL plantations, and shows how the World Bank Group and APPL repeatedly failed to fulfil their obligations,\" said Wilfred Topno, director of PAD, one of three organisations that complained to the World Bank on behalf of workers. The IFC has accepted many of the report's findings. It says it has drawn up an action plan with Tata Global Beverages \"to address shortcomings and legacy issues in key areas such as human health, worker health and safety, housing and sanitation infrastructure\". Tata, which prides itself on its commitment to corporate social responsibility, says it is \"deeply concerned\" about the issues at APPL, and supports the company's efforts to improve the living and working conditions of workers. The companies say they commissioned an independent inquiry into living and working conditions on the APPL estates in 2014 and began to address the problems then. Now they say they will engage an independent organisation to audit the progress of improvements and assess how effective efforts are. But everyone involved in the tea industry recognises that tackling poverty and ill health will be very difficult. Tea workers are trapped in a cycle of dependence that began way back when the first tea estates were planted in India in the 1830s. Very little has changed since then, says Anirudha Nagar, of Accountability Counsel, an organisation supporting the APPL workers. \"With housing tied to their job, they are practically held hostage by their employer,\" he says. \"With abysmally low wages, they face a daily struggle to survive and have no means for advancement. And with poor access to education, their children are left with no option but to become workers themselves.\" So what can be done? Here is what campaigners such as Anirudha Nagar want to see happen. First, pick up that cup of tea again. The answer is not to stop drinking tea. But campaigners argue that tea is just too cheap. They say the big brands need to pay fairer prices to plantations so they in turn can afford decent wages and conditions for workers. They also want a bigger role for unions and NGOs. Tea plantations have traditionally restricted union membership, and sometimes ban NGOs from operating on their estates. They want that to change so workers can know their rights and be able to articulate their demands clearly and effectively. And campaigners believe tea lovers can help too, by using their voice and influence to keep companies honest. They want consumers to tell tea companies that conditions of the workers matter to them, and to challenge their favourite brand about what it is doing to ensure that its employees have decent homes and enough money to buy nutritious food. And once you've sent that text, email or tweet, put the kettle back on. You will have earned yourself a nice cup of tea.

votes were against. It follows pressure from Argentina over its claims to the islands, 31 years after the Falklands War with the UK. The UK government welcomed the result and urged \"all countries\" to accept it and respect the islanders' wishes. The referendum had asked: \"Do you wish the Falkland Islands to retain their current political status as an Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom?\" There was a turnout of more than 90% from 1,672 British citizens eligible to vote in a population of about 2,900. Nigel Haywood, governor of the Falkland Islands, said: \"Obviously it is a major principle of the United Nations that a people have their right to self-determination, and you don't get a much clearer expression of the people's self-determination than such a large turnout and such a large 'yes' vote.\" By Caroline WyattDefence correspondent, BBC News Amongst a sea of union jacks and a chorus of Land of Hope and Glory, there was no doubting the sentiment as jubilant Falkland islanders gathered in Stanley to celebrate their unity over their future, and a referendum that showed 99.8% in favour of remaining British. These may be small islands almost 8,000 miles from the UK, but they have just spoken with a loud voice in favour of retaining those historic ties. The islanders' hope is that their voices will be listened to all the way to Buenos Aires and beyond - not least by other nations and capitals that Argentina has been seeking to convince of its claims. The three people who voted 'no' were presumably not amongst the crowds of voters, although it's not clear whether they voted 'no' in favour of Argentina, or because they favoured independence for the islands. What really stung here was a recent comment by the Argentine foreign minister that the islanders' wishes didn't count because they were what he termed an \"implanted\" population. Though Argentina may not change its mind today, many islanders hope they've shown that their wishes do need to be heard in any debate over their future - and do count. Dick Sawle, a member of the island's legislative assembly, said it was an \"absolutely phenomenal result which will send out the strongest possible message to the rest of the world about our right to self-determination - a right that was fought for in 1982, and which we have honoured tonight.\" Islanders had \"very, very clearly said they wish to remain as a British overseas territory with those rights\", he said, and it would \"be our job now as a government to get that message out to the rest of the world and every country that will listen to us\". He added: \"What is very clear is that these islands never have belonged to Argentina; what is also extremely clear to me here, and from the results that we heard tonight, is that they never will do.\" UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said: \"We have always been clear that we believe in the rights of the Falklands people to determine their own futures and to decide on the path they wish to take. It is only right that, in the 21st Century, these rights are respected. \"All countries should accept the results of this referendum and support the Falkland islanders as they continue to develop their home and their economy. I wish them every success in doing so.\" Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has maintained that the Falkland islanders' wishes are not relevant in what is a territorial issue. Most Argentines regard the islands, which they call Las Malvinas, as Argentine and their recovery is enshrined in the national constitution. Journalist Celina Andreassi, of the Argentina Independent, said: \"The majority of people here agree with the official position that the issue is not about self-determination and it is not about whether the islanders consider themselves British or not - because obviously everyone knows that they do and that they are British. \"The issue for most people here is whether the territory is Argentine or British, not the people themselves.\" Carolina Barros, editor of the Buenos Aires Herald, said the referendum result was \"quite a blow and big news for any Argentine saying that the Malvinas islands belong to Argentina, or that the islanders living there are an implanted population\". \"I don't think it's going to change the mind of the government,\" she said. \"It might change the mind of the Argentines. \"Most of the Argentines think that the territory, the land, belongs to the Argentine map. But most of the Argentines, I think, think that the islanders are entitled to believe or feel themselves like the true inhabitants of the islands after almost nine generations.\" Election observers from different countries oversaw the vote, including representatives of Chile and Mexico - despite an Argentine request for Latin American countries not to take part. Argentine forces invaded the Falkland Islands on 2 April 1982. The garrison of the UK's Royal Marines was overwhelmed and other British South Atlantic territories including South Georgia were also seized. In two months of fighting after the UK military responded, 255 British and about 650 Argentine servicemen were killed, along with three Falklands civilians, before Argentine forces surrendered. Argentina says it inherited the islands from the Spanish crown in 1767 and the islands were seized by Britain in 1833, but the UK says it had long previously established a settlement there and never relinquished sovereignty. It says it has continuously inhabited and administered the islands since 1833.", "text": ["Of", "1,517", "votes", "cast", "in", "the", "two-day", "referendum", "-", "on", "a", "turnout", "of", "more",

By 7:30 am, as the morning fog was still lifting and the sun was starting to appear, the meeting room in the Iowa Falls Fire department was already at full capacity. A few hundred people had travelled from across the state to attend a town hall meeting, filling every chair and corner, and spilling into the hallway. Town halls are traditionally a forum for constituents to discuss their concerns with elected officials, face to face. But in the Trump era, they've taken on a new purpose - with many aggrieved voters seeing them as a way to put pressure on President Trump, by ensuring their members of Congress hold him to account. Republican officials across the country have found themselves on the receiving end of questions and demands from voters. Many, but not all, of those attending are Democrats, some from progressive groups who are organising around these events to ensure people show up. But others are simply frustrated residents, who want their voices heard. All are represented by Senator Chuck Grassley. The vast majority of the crowd at the fire station was older, in their fifties or above. Some of them came with handwritten protest signs, others clutched pieces of paper with their questions written on them. \"I'm new at this,\" a woman named Ingrid told me. She said Trump's victory made her angry. \"I felt I had to come. I'm hoping our voices get larger and that we can make sure Republicans don't just vote along party lines and listen to their constituents.\" And listen is exactly what Senator Grassley did, even if some felt he didn't quite answer all of their concerns. As the seven-term senator entered the room, he began by asking the group which topics they'd like to cover. As hands flew in the air, and people jostled for his attention, a range of topics were raised - everything from Russia to guns, healthcare to education. Senator Grassley wrote the questions down in a small notebook, promising to answer them in the order they were asked. A large majority of questions were about President Obama's healthcare law - the Affordable Care Act. The questions on this were impassioned, as people talked of their personal experiences of Obamacare, and their fears they could lose coverage under a Trump presidency. One elderly man attended on behalf of a friend whose son was seriously ill. He told the senator of how \"his parents will probably have to face bankruptcy just as they face retirement\". Other testimonies reflected the extent people here rely on government subsidised health insurance. \"I'm on Obamacare, if it wasn't for Obamacare we wouldn't be able to afford insurance,\" said Chris Petersen, an insulin dependent diabetic who runs a farm more than an hour away. \"I got a present for you,\" he told the senator, as he held up a box of Tums, a medicine used to relieve heartburn, \"you're going to need them in the next few years.\" When a bespectacled man in a grey sweater asked a question about the national debt, things got testy. As Senator Grassley answered referencing President Trump's taxation plans people began to heckle. \"Raise Trump's taxes,\" yelled a man at the back of the room. \"Everything is going to a pittance,\" shouted a woman. As she did the questioner got angry. \"I asked him, not you, so shut your hole,\" he said, as he jabbed his finger in her direction. At other times the mood in the room was calmer. When Zalmay Naizy, an Afghan who'd been an interpreter for the US army, asked a question, the room fell near silent. \"I'm a Muslim in this country, who's going to save me here? \"I've been shot two times, I've been roadside bombed once, nobody cares about me. But I was with the US.\" The room erupted in cheers, and while the senator didn't address his question right away, choosing to move onto another question about trade deals, he returned to it later, promising to help Zalmay, as he stood by his side. This town hall was held in a county which voted for Donald Trump by a large margin. Senator Grassley prides himself on holding meetings in every county in the state every year through his \"99 county\" pledge, but not all are town halls. He's faced criticism for holding most of those in solidly Republican areas. The event at the fire station was one of two on the same day. Later, in the basement of the Hancock County Sheriff's jail, another crowd gathered. Once again many were waiting outside as the room was at capacity. The mood was tense. \"I want impeachment,\" shouted one man from the back. \"Why are you against government healthcare, but take it yourself?\" asked another. Obamacare dominated the agenda here too, with more personal stories. There was the mother, a former Republican voter, who was concerned about losing healthcare for her son who has disabilities. The veteran worried about treatment of the military. And Jamet, an immigrant from Chile, told the senator \"we're already making this country great\" and asked \"How will you stand up for immigrants?\" \"We need people to stand up for the ordinary working person,\" said Chris Petersen, the farmer with the Tums, who I'd met at the first town hall. His sentiment is not that different to the views of Donald Trump supporters, who told me during the campaign time and time again, that politicians don't represent them. Some who voted for him were at Senator Grassley's town halls, in a show of solidarity. Jim Carson accused Democrats at the events of \"trying to obstruct the good policies of Mr Trump.\" When I asked Senator Grassley if the anger expressed at the town halls would mean he was more likely to confront the president over his agenda, he told me the focus for him was taking these concerns back to his colleagues on capitol hill. \"I don't think you should see it as challenging Trump I think you should see it as Congress doing its job and the president doing his job.\" It was a popular grassroots movement that helped sow the seeds of a Trump presidency, now another is trying to challenge it. For some voters, the only way to get to President Trump is by applying pressure on congress. Senators like Chuck Grassley have to balance their support for the Republican agenda, with the grievances of the voters who keep them in office. Even a small number of people attending town halls can be enough to keep elected officials on edge. These scenes we are seeing at these meetings across America are reminiscent of the early days of the Obama administration, when conservatives attended packed town halls to lobby their congressional representatives on healthcare, in what became known as the Tea Party movement. \"America is starting to boil,\" Chris Petersen told me as I met him afterwards at his farm. As liberals try to exert pressure on their senators and representatives, it's clear that a new progressive movement is brewing.", "text": ["There", "'s", "never", "a", "good", "time", "to", "talk",

She will need another if she is to play at Roland Garros, and unless she makes a flying start when her career resumes, her presence at Wimbledon will be in the hands of the All England Club. The reputation of the Grand Slams is linked intrinsically to the integrity of the sport. Will they take the view that once a ban is served, a decorated former champion like Sharapova should be entitled to unlimited invitations to the world's best events? Or will they share the view of Andy Murray and Caroline Wozniacki that, after a doping ban, players should not be offered shortcuts into tournaments? A former Grand Slam champion is currently free to accept as many wildcards as they wish, but that is a rule which is likely to be reviewed, according to the WTA's chief executive. Steve Simon has also said - in an interview for BBC Sport in Los Angeles - that he is not personally in favour of changing the rule, as a doping ban \"should not wipe out a career's worth of work\". Murray believes that ideally a player should be made to work their way back after a ban by accumulating ranking points in smaller tournaments. Wozniacki was even more direct with her language when she addressed the subject here in Indian Wells. \"When someone has been banned for drugs and something that is performance enhancing, I think that you deserve a second chance like everybody else. People make mistakes, but I think you should fight your way back from the bottom,\" the former world number one Wozniacki said. Other players, like Venus Williams and Simona Halep, believe Sharapova is deserving of wildcards, but it may be that a Grand Slam champion who serves a doping ban loses the right to unlimited wildcards in the future. \"Every rule gets looked at and reviewed, and I'm sure this may be one of them,\" WTA chief executive Simon told me. \"If the members wish us to look at the rule, we will - that's how our system works. \"My personal opinion is that it shouldn't be adjusted unless we decide to not provide it at all and change the entire wildcard rule. I think the suspension is in place to deal with an action that occurred - I don't think it should wipe out a career's worth of work, and in essence that's what people are saying. \"Maria has served a 15 month suspension, has had no income, has lost all of her ranking as well as her Australian Open winnings from 2016 - so she's served a significant penalty for her actions.\" Sharapova will make her return in Stuttgart on Wednesday 26 April, which is the very day her ban expires and two days after the tournament begins. This has upset Angelique Kerber, the German who has won the title for the past two years and will return to the top of the world rankings on Monday. Like Sharapova, she is sponsored by Porsche, the firm also sponsors the tournament, and she is unhappy the Russian has been granted a Wednesday start (although this is not without precedent) and a wildcard which could have been given to a German player. She described it as a \"little strange\", although she is understood to have vented stronger feelings in private. The organisers of the French Open have a big decision to make. It will be too late for Sharapova to gain direct entry into the tournament. And to survive the cut for qualifying - which is made on 1 May - she would have to reach the final in Stuttgart. That would be a mighty achievement after 15 months out of the game, when faced with a field which includes eight of the world's top 10. The French player Jo-Wilfried Tsonga has said publicly he doesn't think the French Tennis Federation should award Sharapova a wildcard and the initial comments of the new FFT president Bernard Giudicelli were not at all reassuring for Sharapova. He told a meeting of the Roland Garros press commission - before he met Sharapova in California - that the tournament would prefer she returned when \"completely rehabilitated\". He described integrity as one of their most important responsibilities and suggested it would be difficult to invite Sharapova at the same time as they have increased their funding for the fight against doping. A decision will be made earlier than is customary. A spokesman for the French Federation has told the BBC that all the wildcards will be determined \"no later than four weeks before the start of the tournament\", which gets under way on 28 May. After the French Open, the surface turns to grass. There are tournaments in the Netherlands, in Mallorca, and then three on British soil in Nottingham, Birmingham and Eastbourne. The LTA says it is yet to discuss or offer wildcards to anyone. Sharapova would need a wildcard to enter at least two, and almost certainly all three of the British events. Announcements tend to be made late on (it is always handy to have a card or two up your sleeve), by which time Sharapova may be committed elsewhere. Whatever the outcome, it seems unlikely the LTA will offer the five time Grand Slam champion a wildcard months in advance so they can use her presence as a marketing tool to drive ticket sales. Which takes us to Wimbledon. Sharapova would probably need to reach a semi-final and a quarter-final from the three events she will play before the entry list is revealed to avoid having her fate determined by the All England Club's tennis sub-committee. If she does not have sufficient ranking points, then Tim Henman could prove to be a significant figure. Henman is not only a board member but also chairs this committee, which traditionally meets to discuss wildcards on the eve of the announcement, which is scheduled this year for Wednesday 21 June. The All England Club aspires to the highest standards and last year announced increased anti-doping measures. My sense from several conversations is that a wildcard may not be offered to Sharapova, if she does indeed require one. That still leaves one final scenario. If Sharapova does not make the main draw by right, she is quite likely to have enough ranking points to enter qualifying. These matches are staged at the Bank of England Sports Grounds in Roehampton, where the public can come and go as they please and media facilities are limited. The grounds seem ill equipped to host Sharapova and all those her presence would attract, but I understand improvements are already high on the All England Club's priority list.", "text": ["The",

of Pop Idol in 2002, prompting him to pick interesting and unexpected collaborators over his six studio albums. It's given him one of the most successful careers of any talent show winner: Young has sold eight million records, won an Ivor Novello Award, and scored four number one albums, including his most recent release 85% Proof. \"I like frailty and vulnerability,\" he says. \"People who let me into their music and songs that evoke an atmosphere.\" As he releases his new single, Thank You, the musician sat down to discuss his five favourite (and one least favourite) records. \"If we did this tomorrow it would be five different albums,\" he laughs. Recorded at Abbey Road studios between April and June 1966, Revolver is the Beatles' first psychedelic masterpiece. Featuring tracks like Taxman, Eleanor Rigby and Good Day Sunshine, it ends with John Lennon's Tomorrow Never Knows - an attempt to condense the experience of an LSD trip into three minutes. It pointed the way forward not just for the Beatles, but popular music as a whole. It was a record that was always played in my house from about the age of 10. It was probably when CDs first came in - my folks got Revolver and Abbey Road and we went away on holiday to South Africa and played it in the house we were staying in. Every song was so different. I'd never heard anything like it before - and never since, actually. Paul McCartney is one of my favourite singers. He's got this brilliant vibrato - but he doesn't rest on it. A Jazz singer would use the vibrato a lot, but his projection is quite straight. He passes through it. I can do quite a good Paul McCartney impression, actually. The follow-up to Thriller, Bad was released to fevered anticipation in 1987. Spawning nine hit singles, from the title track to Smooth Criminal, it marked the point where Jackson transformed from nimble-footed musical genius to paranoid, self-promoting King Of Pop. The key track is Man In The Mirror, a gospel-powered ballad that's equal parts self-reflection and self-flagellation. Bad came out when I was at prep school, aged about nine, and it just took over the school. Everyone had it... on cassette, actually. It was a really strict school. We were only allowed to listen to music on Wednesday, Saturday or Sunday and we weren't allowed to play music out loud. So it really was contained to my own world, on my Walkman. Sonically, it was incredible. He'd moved to a lot harder sound. It became insane, epic. Dirty Diana is incredible - because it's so loud, then suddenly drops out to that fantastic bassline. Michael was a global pop star with Thriller, but this moved him to a completely different sound. The videos and his look - suddenly he had the glove and the leather jacket. The thing was, he wasn't Bad. But I guess as a young kid he did seem quite rebellious. There were all these posh kids running around doing a flick of their leg and saying, \"who's Bad?\" Terence Trent D'Arby's fourth album was a scattershot selection of funk, rock, R&B and heartfelt ballads. A showcase in eclecticism, it was nonetheless short on memorable melodies. The exception was Holding On To You, a low-key love song that became a minor hit in the UK. After the album stalled, the singer was dropped by his record label and changed his name to Sanada Maitreya. I was at public school by this stage, and Vibrator felt like it was my little secret. It's just incredible. Quite avant garde. Very weird. He was posing in a pair of feathered wings on the cover. People probably thought he was a madman. I used to go to athletics meetings - I was quite a keen athlete - and I'd listen to Surrender before I ran the 400 metres. There was something a bit sad about it - but for some reason that's always got me hyped up. A bit like Radiohead. I've always found their music is really powerful and gets me psyched up if I'm doing exercise. When I used to do marathons, I used to listen to Radiohead. The hit from that album was Holding On To You - I don't know where it charted but I remember him on Top of the Pops with his bleached blonde hair, cut really short. He was such a beautiful man. A very feminine-looking man. Still, to this day, no-one has rivalled him vocally. After the Fugees disbanded in 1997, Lauryn Hill branched out and released her solo debut. Updating 70s soul with a hip-hop aesthetic, it sold more than 12 million copies and won five Grammy awards. An intensely personal record, Hill sings about putting her son before her career (To Zion) and her painful break-up with Wyclef Jean (Ex-Factor). \"I was in this tiny village in France and this flower shop was playing The Fugees' cover of Killing My Softly and I thought 'this is the singer I've been waiting for'. Her voice is so crystal, and all her vocal licks are so clear. You hear every note. It's not lazy. It's true great gospel singing in a pop voice. I got this in in my first month at Uni in Exeter. I splashed out and bought it on Minidisc rather than copy it from someone else. It was very lavish. \"At the same time, I fell in love with someone and it was unrequited. It's that song, Tell Him. I used to listen to it over and over and over again. \"Did I tell him? Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We got that out of the way. We're still great friends. He's a great actor. He lives in LA now with his wife. They're lovely. \"I learned how to write songs on my first album,\" said Emiliana Torrini of her debut, released in 1999. A collection of hushed, cherubic electro-pop, it produced a minor UK hit in the shape of To Be Free. The Icelandic singer took six years to follow it up with the vulnerable, confessional Fisherman's Woman and 2008's Me and Armini, whose rambunctious single Jungle Drum became a number one around Europe. When I go into record shops I always ask for three recommendations. So I discovered this when I was in defunct chain store MVC buying Lauryn Hill. I heard this song and asked the staff, who's that playing? Five more Will Young favourites ??? The Black Keys - Attack and Release ??? Sia - Only See ??? Lucy Pearl - Lucy Pearl ??? D'Angelo - Brown Sugar ??? Sade - Love Deluxe It's a really interesting record. It's not an amazing record, actually. I don't come back to it. But I'd mention that as my lead-in to Me and Armini. That should have won awards. That's where she starts getting a bit punchy. There's a song - Gun - I listened to that and I wanted to do a whole dance piece to it. The same with another of the tracks, Big Jumps. I love the softness of her voice, and I love the crack in her voice. Those are the artists I find interesting - that have every emotion and aren't afraid to show it. The frailty and the vulnerability. That's what I've liked about singing and writing - it's like a musical version of the 12 Step programme, except you don't know who else is in the room. I was at Glastonbury and I refused to see him. He's awful. What does he stand for? His arrogance completely over-runs him as a musician. He's so audacious and opulent. It shows the worst of people who have loads of money. Massive weddings, opulent engagements. Who is this man? And why do we laud these people? I'm not interested in arrogance. It's just a cover. Get rid of the arrogance and show me the frailty. I won't listen to his music.

{"raw_text": "The main contributors are the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, the African Development Bank, the European Union and the UK. However things have now taken a bit of a sour turn. It was recently discovered that between 2013 and 2014, Mozambique took out loans to the tune of nearly $2bn (\u00a31.4bn) in order to fund various projects taken on by state-owned companies. The country has a $1bn threshold before it is required to consult its partners. In this controversial case, it seems that more debt was taken on to finance the acquisition of a large tuna factory and the remaining funds are said to have been channelled towards a contract in maritime security and some other deals involving commercial companies in which the state is a leading shareholder. The Mozambican government stood as guarantor of the loans, meaning the state would repay them if things went wrong. There have also been allegations of corruption over the deals but no-one has been arrested or charged. President Filipe Nyusi came to office 18 months ago after the debt had been acquired. He insists that his team knew nothing about this. From his sumptuous office overlooking the Maputo Bay, he told the BBC: \"We also have a number of questions as to why this was not tabled to the National Assembly and correct procedures not followed.\" The IMF, World Bank and UK governments have now decided to hold back on signing further loans to Mozambique. They first want everything to be straightened out. But even this part of the story does not make much sense. After all, Mozambique is a country that has been closely monitored, even coached, by the international community for nearly a decade, following the debt relief the country received a decade ago. The programme was known as the Highly Indebted Poor Country Initiative (HIPC) through which approximately $3bn of Mozambique's bad debts were written often off by the international community. How is it possible that foreign creditors missed the red flags? It is hard to understand how the monitoring system works. Unfortunately we have yet to ask the donor community this simple question directly. Mozambique in numbers: Population: 27 million 55% living in poverty Average annual income per person: $600 Annual economic growth 2010-14: 7.2% Life expectancy: 55 Source: World Bank Foreign creditors are demanding greater transparency in 2016. That may be a challenge for a fairly new president whose loyalties to the governing party, Frelimo, are deep rooted. If indeed there were shenanigans in the acquisition of new debt, his political comrades may have been involved. Nonetheless President Nyusi insists that his anti-corruption drive has not been undermined by the latest scandal. Instead he says that \"things are happening already even in my new cycle of government. \"There are administrators from districts, there are mayors from municipalities and there senior officials from administration who have been taken to responsibility due to embezzlement of resources or corruption.\" However in this saga, the names of senior officials have been mentioned and going after them would be the real test of President Nyusi's mettle. His demeanour in our interview suggests that he has little appetite for that. \"There is a presumption of innocence and we cannot judge to say that so and so has done this or that,\" he said. It is estimated that these undisclosed loans could push up Mozambique's debt to 20% of the value of its economy. That is a heavy burden for small country to bear, especially in today's volatile markets. Also it would be too simplistic to assume that the previous government was only acting irrationally or perhaps with criminal intent. The larger global context should also be considered. Two years ago, before the global markets turned and commodity prices dropped, Mozambique was a very attractive investment destination. The debt write-off from the HIPC era gave the country a clean slate and a new balance sheet. In addition there was also the discovery of natural gas offshore, estimated to be 3 trillion cubic feet. Once tapped, the gas industry could turn Mozambique into the world's fourth largest producer. So the potential to create a new economy around energy is huge. It is probable that at the time, some of these loans were predicated on an expected economic boom in the near future. A case of a government counting its chickens before they hatched. President Nyusi is optimistic that Mozambique will rise above this scandal and says the economy is diverse and has a great deal to offer investors. \"There is gas but gas is not edible. So we still put priority in agriculture,\" he says. While the emphasis is on how the donors have reacted, and what they may do, they are not the only concerned parties. Even ordinary Mozambicans have expressed concerns. Many people are feeling the pinch of rising food prices, a weaker currency and the false hope of jobs that have not materialised in the new energy and gas sectors. Civic leaders tried to launch public protests a week ago, but it has been reported that they were met by armoured vehicles and military patrols. The political agitation is not only centred on these latest concerns, there are growing tensions between the government and opposition Renamo party in the north and central regions. Armed groups loyal to Renamo, a former rebel group, have begun an insurgency. There are frequent skirmishes and aid agencies say that 4,000 people have fled the country becoming refugees in neighbouring Malawi. Despite the headlines, the president insists \"there is no civil war in Mozambique. The government is not interested in war. \"We are merely defending our people against an armed political party. We are defending our democracy.\" But as he defends Mozambique's democracy, he will also need to defend the honour of his administration and Frelimo. The first thing will be to prove that his government is committed to transparency and accountability.", "text": ["The", "main", "contributors", "are", "the", "International", "Monetary", "Fund", "(",

Times to name but a few. And Nile Rodgers is confident he can recreate the dancefloor magic with the band's new track I'll Be There, their first single in 23 years. \"This is real disco,\" Rodgers tells the BBC. \"This is our form of disco, which never sounded like Giorgio Moroder, never sounded like the Village People, never sounded like anyone else. Chic's disco was uniquely ours.\" I'll Be There is the first track from the band's forthcoming album, It's About Time, which Rodgers is currently piecing together from a box of \"lost Chic tapes\" - featuring the original members of the band, of whom Rodgers is the only surviving member. \"I'm rather proud of it,\" says the musician. \"It's music that no one's ever heard before. I wanted to make sure that the music we used was all original stuff, even though there was a riff that we had played before, I just wrote a song on top of it.\" The single is a tribute to Rodgers' producing and song-writing partner, Bernard Edwards, who died in 1996 shortly after Chic came off stage from a gig in Japan. In fact, the whole album is written as if he was \"having a conversation with Bernard\". \"Trying to explain that 'life has gone on and you woke up 20 years later and this is what the world is like,'\" says Rodgers. \"'So you have to view it through my lens and I have to view it through your lens.'\" Rodgers says writing the album was \"emotional\", but also \"refreshing\". \"I was purging, I was cleansing and I was having dialogue.\" Unsurprisingly, given its title It's About Time, the album's \"deep hidden meaning that every Chic song has\" - is the passing of the years. \"Every song is about time. And time-travelling. Time defines everything - the quality of our relationships, the style of music that we're doing,\" says Rodgers. And the 62-year-old is only too aware of how precious time can be. Back in 2010 he was told he had \"extremely aggressive cancer\" and, while he is now in remission, he has vowed to devote as much of the time he has left as possible to making music. There's been no shortage of artists queuing up to share the studio with him. Having helped Daft Punk create one of 2013's biggest tracks, the Grammy Award-winning Get Lucky, he's since teamed up with artists including Disclosure, Sam Smith and Avicii. He says he's assembled a mind-blowing team to record the vocals on a four-part harmony song called Queen. Elton John, Miley Cyrus, Chaka Khan and Janelle Monae will feature on the \"pretty lullaby\", which we can expect to sound \"like Crosby, Stills and Nash meets Chic\". The guest list includes some lesser-known names, too. Rodgers has just written a track with Dutch producer Nicky Romero and Nervo - an Australian DJ and songwriting duo who are twin sisters - which is \"absurd! So good it's crazy\". He calls another new song, with Irish-born, Manchester-based DJ and producer Krystal Klear and Steely Dan's Michael McDonald, 63, \"ridiculous\". \"With any composer, it's the stuff that you're working on right now that you like the most,\" admits the musician. \"I'm really proud of those tracks. And in the scope of the album it makes sense. You have a track that I wrote with Krystal Klear - Declan Lennon was like 20 years old - and Michael is probably older than me, but you hear it and it all makes sense.\" Scheduled for a July release, the album should also feature \"some stuff recorded in Sweden at Abba's studio Polar\", which shut its doors in 2004 but counts Chic as \"the official last band\" to have graced its mixing desk. Having produced stars from Sister Sledge to Duran Duran and been a regular at legendary New York club Studio 54, Rodgers is rarely short of an anecdote, but with such fascinating stories the name-dropping never feels ungracious. There's the time he dreamt up the Diana Ross hit I'm Coming Out, after coming face-to face-with several transvestites dressed as the star in a nightclub toilet. Or when he turned Bowie's Let's Dance from a folk song into the classic 1980s chart-topper. He also revels in telling the story of how Elton John booked Chic for his annual Oscars party last month, then joined them on stage. \"Elton is awesome. I've played with Elton 20 times but I've never played with him in Chic - he was killing it. It was like, 'you should be in my band forever!' He was perfect.\" The story that accompanies Rodgers' new single I'll Be There is tinged with sadness though. \"I have a lyric that says, 'I don't want to live in the past but it's a nice place to visit, and if you come along, I'll be there.' \"I'll be there are the first words that I said to Bernard when I actually realised that he was dead. My brain wouldn't accept the reality. I was screaming at him, I was shaking him. \"At that moment I broke down crying and said: 'Okay, I'll be there for you in death, the way you were there for me in life.' \"Now that's not to sound like this is a morbid dark song,\" he laughs. \"This is a disco song and it's real happy.\" Because of the track's \"deep hidden meaning\" Rodgers wanted to be sure he did something special to mark its release. As a self-confessed \"science guy\", he picked this Friday, 20 March, as the release date - coinciding with the vernal equinox, when we're set to have a partial solar eclipse. The release even has its own hashtag, #CHIClipse. That night the band will also kick off their tour with the first of two dates at London's Roundhouse. \"I don't know what day any of my records came out, ever, but I'll remember this one for the rest of my life. Because people on their way to work in the morning, all of a sudden it's going to get dark! It's like, 'woah! What's going on?'. \"I wanted to do something that's memorable.\" Chic featuring Nile Rodgers start a UK tour at London's Roundhouse on 20 March, and play the British Summer Time festival in Hyde Park with Kylie and Grace Jones on 21 June.", "text": ["Chic", "were", "responsible", "for", "some", "of", "Disco", "'s", "most", "enduring", "hits", ":", "Le", "Freak", ",", "Everybody", "Dance", ",",

tourists looking up in awe at the LED screens that dominate the landscape. Nobody notices the tiny dark figure 350 feet above the pavement clinging to the side of the century old Times Building, home of the New Year's Eve Ball. Jeff Rolfe is a cross between Spider Man and Guy Fawkes, gingerly making his way up and down the side of the building with a bitter winter wind attacking him from every angle as he dangles. In his arms are pre-configured wooden racks full of small explosives. He has to install enough to put smiles on a billion TV viewers worldwide. Thankfully these are the finishing touches to a display of fireworks that in just over 24 hours will hopefully also elicit oohs and aahs from a million New Years Eve revellers in the Square. For almost everyone the thrill of fireworks is an experience that can be traced back to childhood. Yet if you were able to time travel backwards two, three or four decades into history and stand once again in front of your local town display, you would likely be disappointed. Mr Rolfe, from Fireworks By Santore, says few people realise that fountains, rockets, wheels and bursts have all taken a huge step forward thanks to technology. \"The shows used to be much much longer, over an hour in duration. But attention spans are shorter now,\" he says. \"Today, 30 minutes is considered a very long display. Technicians used to manually shoot big shells from steel tube mortars that would need to cool down before the next ones could be fired. It was more relaxed. Now we shoot multiple smaller shells per second from several locations, remotely.\" Songs were played in their entirety rather than the mixed snippets that are favoured today. And any notion of syncing the beats to the bursts was usually a happy accident rather than anything pre-planned. New software and hardware means shells and cannons can be fired remotely up to two miles away and timed to within 1/100th of a second. And in a world full of giant LEDs, laser beams and light shows, fireworks are frequently asked to become team players, which is why \"syncing\" is one of the most sought after skills in the industry. \"Using computer software, we mark where we want the highs and lows of the display to be in relation to the music,\" says Mr Rolfe. \"And then we backtrack all the timings, and create digital cues alongside the music track for the firing sequence in an FSK (Frequency Shift Keying) file. When you hear it, it sounds like the noise made by an old modem.\" Big events, especially those on live TV are usually produced using \"timecode\". A highly accurate digital clock signal is generated from a central source and every person, computer, device and camera at the event uses it as their only time reference. Music tracks, lighting and fireworks can be pre-programmed digitally to flow together perfectly. But it can take months of work by specialist designers to produce a dazzling display. One thing on their side is that the chemical compounds have become more sophisticated. The colours are brighter, the variety of effects has greatly increased and there is far less residual smoke that once might have blocked subsequent bursts. Fireworks today are so chemically precise and stable, a horizontal rocket with a label that says 60 feet will shoot off a building straight out exactly 60 feet, and predictably reach its peak explosion right at the end of that distance without letting gravity pull it down prematurely. Of course timecode and technology are not always perfect, and when things go wrong the motto invented for the digital age - \"all or nothing\" definitely applies. Perhaps the most famous incident was the 2012 Big Bay Boom display in San Diego, which saw about 18 minutes worth of fireworks explode in just 15 seconds thanks to a timecode issue. It could have been the most expensive fireworks display ever (on a per second basis). But firework displays that often cost cities as much as a teacher's annual salary have an upside - successful or not. Officials in San Diego worked out their firework display fiasco still generated about $10m in revenue from local restaurants, tourism, boat hires, and hotel stays. And accidents don't happen as much these days. The biggest problem with older displays was explosions due to sparks from other fireworks in the display. Now the devices are smaller and more spread out so it doesn't happen as often. Corporate requests often drive the direction of the fireworks industry. Companies are increasingly asking for daytime fireworks which have been around for years, but now look much better because once again there are brighter colours and cleverer chemical combinations which make them more dramatic against a bright blue backdrop. Despite the many developments one request that is harder than you'd think is to reproduce corporate logos. Mr Rolfe acknowledges that static logos are easy to do. But firing words and exact shapes from the ground into the sky with 100% accuracy for the entire audience to read from different vantage points is an art form that's in its infancy. \"We are just starting to work with it. The new firing systems allow us to shoot from the same location over and over again to basically form line art. It's not a cheap effect. It takes a bit of trial and error to get the sizing right but when it's done right it's pretty incredible.\" Other companies offer a variation of ways to reproduce airborne corporate designs closer to the ground, such as Flogos, which are made in a portable bubble container and sent off into the sky at a rapid pace. But Mr Rolfe believes the future of fireworks is solid. Despite the rising costs of insurance, security, transportation and storage he thinks that beautiful explosions in the sky will never be trumped by holograms or video screens or anything else.

That said, I opened this post with a question which I will not answer - partly because I work for the BBC and it is not my place to pass judgement on other news organisations' editorial calls and partly because those editorial calls are subjective. But as BBC media editor, and as a former editor of The Independent who had to make thousands of these calls, often against tight deadlines and under great pressure from the subjects of our stories, I want to explore some of the considerations that we editors have to make. Hopefully that will illuminate the hugely controversial decision made this week by Buzzfeed. Editorial judgement is ultimately a moral activity. It is an exercise in selection - which stories, facts, claims, pictures, words, ideas to publish, and which to leave out - that relies on several smaller judgements. These include: the importance you attach to veracity; your own political persuasion; a sense of your audience's interest and - outside the BBC and unfortunately more common now the news business model is under such strain - a consideration of the commercial implications of publishing particular things. The rectitude of all moral activity or actions - editorial judgement included - can be analysed along three criteria: Let's look at Buzzfeed's decision to publish the dossier in terms of intentions and consequences. Some people will argue that - whether you agree with it or not - there is a coherent case for putting information in the public domain even if you are not 100% certain it is true. Ben Smith, the editor-in-chief, has spoken eloquently about how, in our digital era, publishers are no longer gatekeepers of information who demand to be trusted, arguing that Buzzfeed is simply a distributor. His second argument is that because this publication was being circulated widely among government officials, it had tremendous news value and therefore it was in the public interest to put it in the public domain with plenty of caveats so readers could make up their own minds. I know from personal experience that, if you are a digital publisher whose content is free, you mainly make money from advertising, which is related to traffic and which you are under immense pressure to generate. This ultimately commercial imperative can - and does - influence the editorial judgement of many publishers. But let us be charitable to Buzzfeed and say that commercial considerations did not influence this editorial decision. Buzzfeed has a young audience and often publishes journalism associated with the political Left, unlike Trump whose most stable constituency is older voters on the Right. It is reasonable to conclude that one reason Buzzfeed published this dossier about Mr Trump is that it calculated it could harm someone it does not like. So Buzzfeed, having put traffic considerations aside, and being antithetical to some of the things Mr Trump stands for, calculated that the document, which had potentially huge implications for the incoming president, deserved to be seen in its entirety by readers who want access to information. That covers the intentions, but what of the consequences? Huge traffic for this article must have been one consequence. Another is that Buzzfeed, as a powerful international brand, is now clearly associated with a willingness to publish information it knows could be false. Another consequence is of course that the information contained in the dossier, some of it untrue, much of it not corroborated, is now in the public domain we call cyberspace. Perhaps citizens across the globe are digesting it to better understand the incoming president. Finally, life has been made harder for other news organisations, such as The New York Times and CNN, who Trump targeted in his remarkable press conference. They have now been conflated with Buzzfeed under Trump's pernicious umbrella term \"fake news\". Buzzfeed could reasonably say it is not its job to secure access to Mr Trump for CNN - and in any case the president-elect was not exactly friendly with the mainstream media before the dossier's publication. It will be for editors and citizens everywhere to decide, in balancing Buzzfeed's intentions with the (largely foreseeable) consequences, whether it made a correct editorial judgement. That in turn depends on your moral position - your commitment to truth and so on. What really interests me is that Mr Smith is saying that the digital revolution has redefined journalism, creating publishers who are prepared to put lots of information into the public domain without verifying it. There is a difference, however, between Wikileaks, who do that sort of thing, and what most journalists understand their role to be: corroborating information before making selections as to what should be published. In a sense, Mr Smith's position is an argument against journalism, in that being gatekeepers who curate and edit the world is precisely what many hacks believe their role to be. Just as traditional media included many different types of publisher - tabloids v broadsheets, for example - so new, digital media include those who exhaustively check their facts and proceed with caution and those who are prepared to publish unverified allegations because they think the public should know. The BBC is in the former camp, as my colleague Paul Wood argued in his excellent blog. We work very hard to verify claims before publishing them: so much so that there are always big stories we know about that we cannot use, because we haven't got sufficiently solid sourcing. Our political editor Laura Kuenssberg has talked about this - and I can certainly relate to it. Together with Mr Trump, this controversy helps to illuminate how fast the media is changing - and how it affects all our lives.", "text": ["That", "comes", "down", "to", "editorial", "judgement", ",",

partners\". PM Theresa May set out her Brexit strategy, including leaving the EU single market, in a speech on Tuesday. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker promised to work for \"good results\" from Brexit talks. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has announced it will give its verdict next Tuesday on the government's legal battle over whether MPs must be consulted before Brexit is triggered. And HSBC announced it was preparing to move 1,000 staff from London to Paris when the UK leaves the EU. At Prime Minister's Questions, Mrs May clashed with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, telling him she had a \"plan\" and he did not \"have a clue\". Mr Corbyn accused her of \"threatening to turn Britain into an offshore tax haven\". With just over two months to go before the UK government is due to get Brexit talks under way, Mr Johnson was asked on a trip to India about comments by an aide to French President Francois Hollande, who said the UK should not expect a better trading relationship with the EU after leaving it. He replied: \"If Monsieur Hollande wants to administer punishment beatings to anybody who chooses to escape, rather in the manner of some World War Two movie, then I don't think that is the way forward. \"I think, actually, it's not in the interests of our friends and our partners.\" Downing Street later said Mr Johnson \"was not in any way suggesting anyone was a Nazi\". The spokeswoman said the remarks were \"all being hyped up\" and that the foreign secretary had used a \"theatrical comparison\", adding: \"There is not a government policy of not talking about the War.\" But a Labour spokesman said: \"The foreign secretary has a habit of making wild and inappropriate comments. Talking about World War Two in that context is another one of those and not something that's going to improve the climate for negotiations.\" Former cabinet minister and Brexit campaigner Michael Gove hit back, tweeting that people offended by Mr Johnson's \"witty metaphor\" were \"humourless, deliberately obtuse, snowflakes\". EU leaders have begun to deliver their verdicts on Mrs May's speech, in which she also warned against trying to \"punish\" the UK for Brexit and hinted she could walk away from talks if not happy, stating that \"no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain\". German Chancellor Angela Merkel said: \"The be-all and end-all is that Europe does not let itself be divided, and we will ensure that with very intensive contacts.\" EU governments would consult their business sectors, she added, and she was \"not worried that we will not stick together\". Mr Juncker said he would work to ensure Brexit talks are carried out \"according to the rules and they yield good results\". He added: \"I welcome the clarifications given by Mrs May, but I said to her last night that a speech will not launch the negotiations.\" Analysis - By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent Not surprisingly, uproar has ensued. Former Labour leader Ed Miliband said Boris Johnson had shown once again that he could be \"supremely clever and yet immensely stupid\". To some Britons, Mr Johnson's remarks will be seen as colourful but unexceptional language that echoes the popular World War Two film The Great Escape. To many of Mr Johnson's generation, these films were part of their childhood and are subject to frequent cultural reference. Former Prime Minister David Cameron has seen The Guns of Navarone more than 17 times and once quoted a line from the film in a party conference speech. Read James's blog in full Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's lead Brexit negotiator, said: \"You can say, 'I want to leave the European Union, I want to leave the judicial courts, I want to leave the customs union.' \"But you cannot at the same time then say, 'Oh, and that little piece that interests me, and that is something that I like.' No way.\" However, European Council President Donald Tusk was more conciliatory, tweeting: \"We took note of Prime Minister May's warm, balanced words on European integration. Much closer to narrative of Churchill than President-elect Trump.\" Downing Street said European leaders spoken to by Mrs May in a series of phone calls had welcomed the \"clarity\" of her plans. In its headline, the Times sums up the prime minister's message to the EU as \"Give us a fair deal or you'll be crushed\". Meanwhile, the Brexit-supporting Daily Mail draws parallels with Margaret Thatcher, saying Mrs May exhibited the \"steel of the new Iron Lady\". The Guardian, which opposed Brexit in the referendum, found the speech a \"doubly depressing event\" - a reality check for those who want to keep the UK in the single market while being riddled with its own streak of \"global fantasy\". The Financial Times praises the prime minister's \"bold vision\" but warns that the road ahead will be perilous. The Sun's front page is mocked up as a Biblical tablet of stone bearing the single-word headline \"Brexodus\". Read The Papers in full In her speech, the prime minister suggested the UK could cut its corporate tax rates to compete with the EU if denied access to the single market. And she promised that Parliament would get to vote on the final Brexit deal. Asked what would happen if MPs and peers rejected it, Brexit Secretary David Davis told Today: \"They won't vote it down. This negotiation will succeed. It will succeed.\" The government says it will invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, getting formal Brexit talks with the EU under way, by the end of March, with discussions set to last up to two years after that. A \"catalogue of demands with some threats thrown in\" is German news magazine Der Spiegel's description of Theresa May's Brexit speech. It says that her desire to leave the single market while retaining access to trade with Europe shows that her government is \"not just nasty but also blind to reality\". Germany's Die Welt also mocks her with the headline \"Little Britain\" and accuses her of leading the country into \"isolation\". In Italy, La Repubblica's front page reads \"Brexit: London raises its wall 'away from the EU and the single market'\". France's Liberation remarks that Mrs May's comment that no deal is better than a bad one suggests that she is threatening to turn Britain into a tax haven. \"If this is not blackmail, it looks a lot like it,\" it says. At Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Corbyn urged Mrs May to \"stop her threat of a bargain basement Brexit, a low-paid tax haven on the shores of Europe\". He added: \"It won't necessarily damage the EU but it would certainly damage this country.\" Mrs May told MPs: \"What I set out yesterday was a plan for a global Britain, bringing prosperity to this country and jobs to people and spreading economic growth across this country.\" UKIP leader Paul Nuttall said: \"It's clear that Britain is going global, as a result of that momentous EU referendum vote on 23 June.\"", "text": ["The", "foreign", "secretary", "said", "penalising", "``", "escape", "''", "was", "``", "not", "in", "the", "interests", "of", "our", "friends", "and", "our", "partners",

under the sea-ice of the Arctic - from one side of the ocean basin to the other. It is a journey of at least 2,500km - and while nuclear subs might routinely do it, the prospect is a daunting one for a battery-operated research vehicle. The trip could happen in 2018 or 2019. \"It represents one of the last great transects on Earth for an autonomous sub,\" said Prof Russell Wynn, from the National Oceanography Centre, Boaty's UK base. \"Previously, such subs have gone perhaps 150km (horizontally) under the ice and then come back out out again. Boaty will have the endurance to go all the way across the Arctic.\" Such a mission would give scientists rare insight into conditions that hold sway under the ice floes' more persistent regions. The chubby underwater vehicle was formally introduced to the public on Monday at a keel-laying ceremony for Britain's new \u00a3200m polar ship - the RRS Sir David Attenborough. An online poll had called for the big research vessel to carry the humorous nickname, but the government thought better of it, reserving the name Boaty for one of the Attenborough's robots instead. The polar ship will not be on the water until 2018, and so the yellow sub is going to have to wait to get onboard. In the meantime, it will engage in some solo work having successfully completed a series of advanced sea trials. This coming Antarctic research season, Boaty will be deep diving in the Southern Ocean to study how bottom currents move. Early next year it will be in the North Sea gathering data to assist scientists as they try to understand how and where carbon dioxide could be buried offshore. Prof Wynn, who heads NOC's Marine Autonomous and Robotic Systems (Mars) section, has high hopes for Boaty. It represents, he says, something of a step-change in capability. Qualified to reach a depth of 6,000m, the sub can operate for extended periods without any intervention from humans. \"I like to think of Boaty as the marathon-running equivalent of our other underwater vehicles in that it goes deeper, longer but slower. So we have other yellow submarines that go for a couple of days before we have to recover them and recharge the batteries. But the idea with Boaty is that it can operate for months, working in the deepest parts of the ocean.\" The research possibilities are myriad. Sensors can track changes in water temperature, in salinity and density, and in the amount of oxygen that is present. Other instruments will image zooplankton and fish shoals in the water column. Still more equipment will listen for marine mammals like whales and dolphins. A must-have for Boaty is smart navigation. Working under ice, for example, prevents it getting a GPS fix by rising to the surface. The use of a compass is also problematic in polar regions. \"One of the things we're going to do is teach Boaty to read a map,\" said Prof Wynn. \"You give it a map of the seabed in its brain and then as it travels it uses sonar to collect data that it can compare with the stored map. This should tell it where it is. It's a neat concept but it's never been tested over thousands of km before.\" The sub and its \"mothership\", the Attenborough, will have a \u00a31m education programme put behind them. The Natural Environment Research Council, which runs most polar science in the UK, is keen to exploit the popular interest generated around the naming vote. Schools will be able to apply for education packs centred on ocean and polar topics. And STEM ambassadors will also be working with children to bring these subjects alive. \"With Boaty and the RRS Sir David Attenborough as integral resources, the Polar Explorer Programme will use videos and images and updates from missions to achieve a real change in the aspirations and attainment of many young people in STEM subjects,\" science minister Jo Johnson told the keel-laying ceremony at Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead. \"We want to inspire children to be confident in their skills, curious about their world and bold in their ambitions. But we also want to inspire people of all ages around the world to recognise the wonder and importance of our frozen planet.\" Boaty is the latest in a long line of robots that have had the anthropomorphism treatment. But be warned if you plan to get attached to this particular plucky sub. \"We do occasionally lose our vehicles, and they can get caught in fishing nets from time to time,\" cautioned Prof Wynn. \"There could well be some dramas ahead for those people who plan to follow Boaty on his missions. \"But this is what we do. These vehicles are like the Mars rovers of the oceans which we send out into hostile places to get their data that they then send back to us via satellite. And, yes, we are quite likely to have some highs and some lows.\" Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos", "text": ["Scientists", "plan", "to", "send", "the",

"Eight journalists and two policemen were among the dead. Police issued photos of two suspects, describing them as \"armed and dangerous\". A third suspect reportedly handed himself in to police. Protests and vigils over the attack, the deadliest the country has seen in decades, have been held across France. President Francois Hollande called it a \"cowardly murder\" and declared a day of national mourning on Thursday. He said the country's tradition of free speech had been attacked and called on all French people to stand together. \"Our best weapon is our unity,\" Mr Hollande said in a televised address late on Wednesday. Security has been stepped up across France in the wake of the attack, with Paris placed on the highest alert. Police said arrest warrants had been issued for Cherif Kouachi, 32, and his brother Said, 34, who they said were believed to be \"armed and dangerous\". Another suspect, Hamyd Mourad, 18, was named earlier in a police document, according to media reports. However, unnamed officials said that Mr Mourad handed himself in to police after seeing his name circulating on social media. He was arrested and taken into custody, AFP reported. Media reports described Cherif Kouachi as a militant sentenced in 2008 to three years in prison for belonging to a group sending jihadist fighters to Iraq. BBC Paris correspondent Lucy Williamson says there are separate reports of police operations taking place outside the capital and in the eastern city of Reims, 140km (90 miles) from Paris. Police did not give any details but forensic teams were later seen searching an apartment in Reims. The satirical weekly has courted controversy in the past with its irreverent take on news and current affairs. It was firebombed in November 2011 a day after it carried a caricature of the Prophet Muhammad. The attack took place as the magazine was holding its weekly editorial meeting. French media have named three cartoonists killed in the attack as Cabu, Tignous and Wolinski, as well as Charlie Hebdo contributor and French economist Bernard Maris. Charlie Hebdo editor Stephane Charbonnier, 47, had received death threats in the past and was living under police protection. Cartoonist Corinne Rey, said the hooded gunmen entered the building after forcing her to enter the code to open the door. \"They said they belonged to al-Qaeda,\" she said, adding they had spoken in fluent French. Eyewitnesses said they heard as many as 50 shots fired by the attackers both inside the Charlie Hebdo office and on the streets outside. The gunmen were captured on amateur video shooting one injured police officer at point blank range in the head on the pavement outside. They were heard shouting \"we have avenged the Prophet Muhammad\" and \"God is Great\" in Arabic (\"Allahu Akbar\"). Police said the masked gunmen fled to northern Paris, before abandoning their car and hijacking a second one. The Paris prosecutor, Francois Molins, said 11 people had been wounded in the attack, four of them seriously. He told reporters all efforts were being made to find those responsible, without giving any details about the investigation. \"The investigations have been numerous and in-depth, because of course, the police have been mobilised, and these inquiries are going on.\" The killings have been condemned by leaders worldwide, with US President Barack Obama offering to help France track down those responsible. Al-Azhar University in Cairo, Sunni Islam's leading centre of learning, called the attack \"criminal\" and said \"Islam denounces any violence\". The Arab League also condemned the attack. Pope Francis called it \"abominable\". Thousands of people have gathered at the Place de la Republique in central Paris for a vigil, many holding up placards saying \"Je suis Charlie\" (I am Charlie), referring to a hashtag that is trending on Twitter in solidarity with the victims. Piles of pens - symbolising freedom of expression - and candles have been laid across the square. Tens of thousands of people have also joined rallies in other cities across France. Charlie Hebdo's website, which went offline during the attack, is displaying the single image of \"Je suis Charlie\" on a black banner. Other major newspapers are displaying similar banners. The latest tweet on Charlie Hebdo's account was a cartoon of the Islamic State militant group leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Charlie Hebdo is part of a venerable tradition in French journalism going back to the scandal sheets that denounced Marie-Antoinette in the run-up to the French Revolution. The tradition combines left-wing radicalism with a provocative scurrility that often borders on the obscene. Its decision to mock the Prophet Muhammad in 2011 was entirely consistent with its historic raison d'etre. The paper has never sold in enormous numbers - and for 10 years from 1981, it ceased publication for lack of resources. But with its garish front-page cartoons and incendiary headlines, it is an unmissable staple of newspaper kiosks and railway station booksellers. Charlie Hebdo and its satirical role Live updates Europe's struggle with Islamism The country was already on the alert for Islamist militant attacks after several incidents just before Christmas, although the French government has denied the attacks were linked. It is the deadliest attack in France since 1961, when a bomb planted by far-right militants opposed to plans for Algerian independence killed 28 people on a train. Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, which published cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in 2005 sparking riots in Muslim countries, says it has stepped up security in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo

Sergio Garcia and Rafa Cabrera-Bello beat JB Holmes and Ryan Moore 3&2, with Rory McIlroy and Thomas Pieters beating Dustin Johnson and Matt Kuchar 3&2. But Brooks Koepka and Brandt Snedeker won 5&4 against Danny Willet and Martin Kaymer to ensure the US remain ahead. \"I would definitely say it's better to have a small deficit with some momentum because we didn't have much at lunchtime,\" said Europe captain Darren Clarke. \"The guys went back out there and they showed just why I'm so proud of them. They showed a massive amount of desire and the fight in them to get themselves right back into it again.\" US captain Davis Love said: \"Obviously I'm happy to be 5-3. I like being ahead but I keep telling our guys there's eight points a day and then there's 12 points on Sunday.\" After failing to win a point in a session for the first time since 1981, Europe improved dramatically - especially on the greens - to ensure their quest for a fourth successive Ryder Cup was not effectively ended in just one day at Hazeltine. Still, the hosts hold a healthy advantage as they look to win the event for only the third time in 23 years, though it will not be lost on visiting captain Darren Clarke that Europe trailed 5-3 after the first day of their remarkable comeback win at Medinah four years ago. Both the 3-1 scoreline and margin of European victories in the fourballs not only quelled the rowdy home crowd, but also reversed the momentum of the 41st Ryder Cup, leaving the contest delicately poised for Saturday morning's foursomes. Stenson and Rose trailed Spieth and Reed for almost all of the morning foursomes and looked set for a long afternoon in the Minnesota sunshine as the Americans began with more electric putting. But after the US putters finally failed on the fourth, Sweden's Open champion Stenson dragged his team along, making birdie on the seventh when Rose went in the water, then knocking his tee shot on the eighth to gimme range. Though Rose was below his best, Spieth and Reed became erratic after falling behind for the first time in 25 holes, their first Ryder Cup defeat as a pair engineered by the imperious Stenson. If the European turnaround was sparked by their most experienced pair, it was continued by Spanish rookie Cabrera-Bello, who was relaxed enough to be seen encouraging his vastly experienced compatriot Garcia on the way to the first tee. Cabrera-Bello, who sat out the morning, promptly birdied the first then, after a Garcia birdie for two up, put his team another hole to the good with a par on the seventh despite finding water off the tee. Garcia faded in the morning session but found life in his putter in the afternoon - and though Holmes cut the lead from four to two, victory was sealed on the 16th. Belgian Pieters improved throughout the morning, despite being on the end of a heavy defeat in partnership with England's Lee Westwood. Paired with Europe's leading player McIlroy in the afternoon, he found a team-mate to share the load, with two birdies each giving the visitors four successive holes on the front nine. Pieters drained an 18-foot putt on the 13th to draw a roar from McIlroy, before a birdie each from Johnson and Kuchar cut the lead to two. But, with American momentum growing, McIlroy produced a wonderful approach to reach the par-five 16th in two, then bowed to the crowd as he holed the eagle putt that completed the win. If Pieters benefitted from his more experienced partner, fellow rookie Willett - lightly booed on the first tee after the controversy caused by a magazine article written by his brother - was let down by two-time major winner Kaymer. Not once on the front nine did the German provide the better ball for his team, who were subsequently overrun by big-hitting American debutant Koepka and the precise-putting Snedeker. Europe captain Darren Clarke on Sky Sports: \"I'm massively proud of them. They were bitterly disappointed at lunchtime but the guys came out this afternoon and the golf was scintillating.\" United States captain Davis Love: \"You know it's going to be a close match. We had a great morning, they had a great afternoon. We shot low scores, just got beat by a team playing unbelievable golf. We need to start over again tomorrow. It's another day and we try to win every session.\" Europe's Rory McIlroy on BBC Radio 5 live: \"The consensus at lunch was we have to chip away at the lead. I don't think we could have dreamed it any better this afternoon and we are probably going into our locker room a little bit happier than they are this afternoon.\" Europe vice-captain Ian Poulter: \"The team was pretty low at lunchtime. It's been a long time since it's been 4-0 in a morning session, but the guys dug deep. That morning session was painful, but the afternoon was incredible. We can hear our crowd now.\" BBC chief sports writer Tom Fordyce It was a dramatic opening day in a competition that specialises in the sort of see-saw excitement that few other sporting events can match. At midday the course was a sea of Stars and Stripes, McIlroy and Sullivan's foursomes defeat on the 18th to Mickelson and Fowler, having been two up with four to play, was perhaps the most chastening European moment of all. Yet in the afternoon the vast galleries were silenced by a European charge that brought back stirring memories of Medinah four years ago, and nothing epitomised that better then McIlroy's eagle putt on the 16th to see off Johnson and Kuchar with the impressive Pieters.

The year-long review will also consider the breadth of the home secretary's discretion to intervene in cases. It follows a series of high-profile cases, including that of computer hacker Gary McKinnon. The Home Office says the current extradition arrangements will continue and the review will not impact on any cases currently under consideration. The review panel, led by a retired Law Lord, is expected to be finished by the end of summer 2011. Former Home Secretary David Blunkett, who signed the treaty, accused the current Home Secretary Theresa May of kicking the controversy \"into the long grass\". Recently, he admitted he might have \"given too much away\" to the Americans and said sensible discussions with the UK's partners could resolve \"any irritants quite speedily\". The review will consider the operation of the Extradition Act 2003, including the European arrest warrant, and the US/UK extradition treaty. Home Secretary Theresa May said: \"I am fully aware there are a number of areas of the UK's extradition arrangements which have attracted controversy in recent years. \"This government is committed to reviewing those arrangements to ensure they work both efficiently and in the interests of justice.\" The European arrest warrant fast-tracks extradition between EU member states. It means countries can ask for extradition of an individual without providing prima-facie evidence to the courts, usually as long as the offence is a crime in both countries and carries a prison sentence of more than one year. Jago Russell, Fair Trials International's chief executive, said more than one thousand people were detained and extradited by the UK in the year 2009-2010 \"under Europe's no-questions-asked extradition system\". \"This review, though welcome, will only produce a fairer system of extradition if it gets to grips with the problems caused by the European arrest warrant and if vital new safeguards are put in place,\" he said. Critics of the US/UK treaty, agreed between Washington and London in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks of 2001, say it is easier to extradite people from the UK than the US. By Dominic CascianiBBC News home affairs correspondent Extradition treaties are a crucial tool in the state's armoury against criminality: they give prosecutors the means to haul back wrongdoers - thereby enhancing public confidence in the rule of law. But the modern British system has become controversial partly because of the manner of its creation. The current deal with the US and the separate European Arrest Warrant emerged in the post 9/11 world. Politicians on both sides of the Atlantic concluded that agencies needed to act more swiftly to transfer suspects - and the former British Labour government promoted reforms with one eye on tackling the threat from international terrorism. But critics say the arrangements were, in effect, rushed into law and, in doing so, failed to include proper judicial safeguards against abuse. They point to cases like Gary Mann, convicted in Portugal of football-related violence after what he says was an unfair trial. Former Labour ministers stand by the deals and want to remind the new government that the law brought one of the failed 21/7 suicide bombers to justice, after he fled to Rome. They say the arrangement is not reciprocal because the US does not need to present evidence to a British court to request extradition, while the UK still needs to present evidence to an American court. The treaty was originally designed to make it easier to bring terrorist suspects to justice but campaigners say it is being used to seek extradition for other offences such as fraud and drug trafficking. Conservative MP David Davis said Mr McKinnon's case and others showed \"how ill thought out\" some aspects of the agreements were. \"This review should also incorporate the proposed European Investigation Order which has further scope for unintended miscarriages of justice in which British citizens are penalised for actions which are not breaches of British law,\" he said. Shami Chakrabarti, director of civil rights group Liberty, said Britain's \"rotten extradition system\" was in urgent need of an overhaul. \"No-one should be parcelled off to a foreign land without due process or when they could be dealt with here at home - people in the UK have been vulnerable to accusation and transportation across the globe for far too long,\" she said. But shadow home secretary Alan Johnson said the European arrest warrant has been \"fundamental in helping the police return wanted criminals\". And he added that the US \"is a trusted and valued extradition partner\". \"Whilst the terms of our respective legal systems are different, the substance of the extradition tests applied in each country under the agreement are broadly the same,\" Mr Johnson said. \"There is no significant evidence to suggest an imbalance. \"Again it would be surprising if this review led to any meaningful change in the current arrangements we have with the United States.\" Glasgow-born Mr McKinnon, who has Asperger's syndrome, is accused of hacking into US military computer systems. Mr McKinnon, 43, of Wood Green, north London, does not deny hacking into systems but insists he was seeking evidence of UFOs. Both Prime Minister David Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg have publicly condemned plans to extradite Mr McKinnon to the US - where he faces up to 60 years in jail. American authorities allege that between February 2001 and March 2002, Mr McKinnon hacked into dozens of US army, navy, air force and Department of Defense computers, as well as 16 Nasa computers. They also say Mr McKinnon altered and deleted files at a US naval air station not long after the 9/11 attacks. In May, the home secretary agreed to an adjournment of a High Court decision on whether his extradition could go ahead.", "text": ["Campaigners", "say", "the", "agreement", "is", "biased", "against",

"Seriously, did anyone else know this? Even those who only take a vague interest in Scottish gymnastics will be familiar with the names Steve Frew and Adam Cox. Frew took gold in the men's rings at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, while Cox won the high bar bronze at Melbourne in 2006. But Jo Walker? Apparently she is a rhythmic gymnast who won bronze in the hoop in 1994 at the Victoria Games. I was intrigued. I decided to track her down - it would be easy. I typed her name into a search engine... Much fruitless internet and social media searching later, I was eventually led to the owner of a gymnastics club in Swakopmund in Namibia, who managed to get hold of Jo's mobile number. Winning a medal was a bit surreal. It was something that I wanted, had dedicated hours of hard work for, but never really expected due to my own lack of self belief. When it did happen and I was standing on the podium, I remember thinking that at least I can retire from the sport having achieved something tangible. After all the years and hours of hard work, pain, tears and sacrifice - to retire without that would have felt like it was all a bit of a waste of time. There was no media attention, no fame or fortune! But there was no media attention, no fame or fortune! I'm now 43, living with my partner in Noordhoek, Cape Town, South Africa, with my step-daughter and our dog. I work in the film industry as a production manager - mainly working on international commercials. I enjoy rock climbing, mountain biking, trail running and drinking copious amounts of red wine! I was born in Paisley, but grew up in Otley, West Yorkshire where I started ballet and artistic gymnastics. I was getting too tall (I'm now 5'10\") for \"normal\" gymnastics and was always very supple, so physically I was much better suited to rhythmic gymnastics. One of my sisters was doing rhythmic at her local school so I went to try. My mum didn't think I would enjoy it as the floor was my least favourite discipline in artistic gymnastics. However, she was wrong and I carried on! Jo's tips for Team Scotland's three rhythmic gymnasts competing at the Glasgow Games: Rebecca Bee, Lauren Brash and Victoria Clow. When I was about 13, I moved to Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, with my parents and two sisters. I trained at Cranford Rhythmic Gymnastics Club and later moved to Hillingdon School of Gymnastics. In hindsight, I realise my family made huge sacrifices. But at the time, things just evolved to longer hours, more days training, and further to drive - especially when I made the regional squad. Without them it would have been impossible for me to achieve what I did and still turn out to be a relatively normal person! Despite lots of trials, I kept missing the cut for the national squad of 30 girls. My big break didn't come until 1989, when I was already considered old at 18! Russian coach Iriner Viner was appointed the GB coach and she cut the squad from 30 to 10. I made it onto the team. I did what any self respecting gymnast does when they retire - I ate chips and drank lots of beer ... and got fat! I went on to represent Great Britain in many European competitions, as well as three World Championships, and two European Championships. At that time Scotland wasn't really on the map with regards to rhythmic gymnastics. Yet when I tried to compete for Scotland at the 1990 Commonwealth Games, I wasn't accepted due to the fact that I didn't live in Scotland. By this point, I was training five to six days a week for three to four hours a day. For two months, I had been on a gruelling training regime at the National Olympic Centre in Moscow, Russia. It was so disappointing. I was born in Scotland, and I even have great Scottish sporting heritage! My grandfather, George Walker, was capped four times for Scotland's national football side in the early 1930s. His uncle, Bobby Walker, was capped 30 times in the early 1900s and has just been inducted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame. After a bit of lobbying, I was accepted onto Scotland's 1994 Commonwealth Games team. By then, I was second overall in the British Championships, and individual winner in hoop, ribbon and clubs. The closest Scottish competitor was way down in the rankings, and finally I seemed like a good option for Scotland. After my success at the Commonwealth Games, I retired from the sport and moved to Namibia to take up the post of national coach for a few years. It was meant to be for six months but I fell in love with the country so stayed. Finishing my university degree, moving to a completely new continent, no longer having to worry about what I ate, not training 24/7, not being worried about what I looked like in a leotard, was all a complete upheaval of everything that I had spent almost the last 15 years of my life doing. I started making up for lost years and I did what any self respecting gymnast does when they retire - I ate chips and drank lots of beer, gained 20 kgs (about 3st) and got fat! I always put on my Scotland rugby top every time Scotland are playing South Africa While in Namibia I realised that I was talented in other sports. However, I knew that I did not want to do an indoor sport ever again - though that could have had something to do with the beautiful African sunshine. I cannot imagine being a coach potato and I'm like a dog locked in a house if I haven't exercised for a few days. And in case you are wondering, I eventually lost 12kgs! I started playing two-a-side beach volleyball and was Namibian ladies champion for a few years. My volleyball partner was very patient with the way I pointed my toes whiles gracefully diving for the ball! I learned to skydive and got involved in filming tandem skydivers when the local club needed extra help. I started mountain biking and was the Namibian \"veteran ladies\" downhill champion for a year - though I was the only competitor! Then my South African partner introduced me to the sport of rock climbing, which I love. It combines hiking a few hours to the bottom of a peak, with the adrenalin of the actual three hours of climbing, and then the rush to get down the mountain side before dark and without getting mugged! I also enjoy watching sport, and I always put on my Scotland rugby top every time Scotland are playing South Africa and endure the taunts and sympathy from the usually victorious locals. Having talked to my sisters over the past few years and asked them if they were annoyed by the amount of time our parents spent driving me around, they said that they were always very proud of what I achieved - although they never mentioned it at the time! In our family I was never made to feel special. I was one of three children. It wasn't just about me, I just happened to do gymnastics.

- and he urged those thinking about defecting to get in touch with him \"for the sake of the country\". A UKIP source has also told BBC News the party is talking to five to 10 Labour MPs about possible defection. But this was firmly denied by Labour, who accused UKIP of mischief-making. Mr Carswell officially resigned as an MP on Friday, a day after he announced he was quitting the Conservatives and would fight a subsequent by-election as a UKIP candidate because he did not believe David Cameron was \"serious\" about reforming Britain's relationship with Europe. The prime minister described the move as \"slightly bizarre\", telling reporters that Mr Carswell was one of those who wanted to leave the EU irrespective of the outcome of negotiations he was confident would lead to a better deal for Britain in Europe. \"He fought as a Conservative in 2010 when we didn't have a commitment to an in-out referendum and he has left the Conservative Party at a time we do have a commitment to an in-out referendum - that is a question for him to explain rather than me.\" Mr Carswell's defection prompted a flurry of speculation that other Eurosceptic backbenchers would jump ship - fuelled by Mr Wheeler's revelation that he had discussed the possibility with eight of them in recent years, although he declined to name names. He told BBC News he had approached 10 Tory MPs and eight had agreed to meet him secretly for lunch at his favourite Italian restaurant in Mayfair. They did not include Mr Carswell, he revealed, adding that UKIP leader Nigel Farage had handled that defection personally, and he had not always directly asked them to defect, just inquired whether they wanted to meet Mr Farage. Asked by BBC Radio 4's Becky Milligan, if any of them had been tempted to defect, he said: \"I am sure they will be tempted but the question is whether they give into that temptation.\" Asked about the likelihood of other defections before the general election, he said: \"If I had to put money on, one way or another, before I knew the result of this by-election, I would say odds on, more likely than not but only just.\" MPs wanting to discuss their future should contact him in the strictest of confidence, added the former Tory donor. \"For the sake of the country they should defect because we are doing the right thing for the country and the Conservative Party are doing the wrong thing,\" he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One. A senior UKIP source also told Becky Milligan that the party was talking to five to ten Labour MPs about possibly changing affiliation. The MPs in question, the source said, were \"deeply unhappy with their party, and feel that people are fed up being patronised by the Labour glitterati\". But Labour firmly denied any of its MPs were in talks with UKIP or considering defection. Shadow defence secretary Vernon Coaker said: \"I'm not about to jump and you won't see other Labour MPs jumping.\" He said he was not aware of any Labour MPs who had sufficient doubts about Labour's stance on Europe to look elsewhere. Mr Farage, who visited Mr Carswell's constituency with his new colleague, said he was \"constantly\" talking to Eurosceptics in the Tory and Labour Party. Mr Farage told reporters: \"There is only one party for a genuine Eurosceptic. That is UKIP.\" He said talk of further defections was \"speculation\", but added: \"If Douglas Carswell wins this by-election, and I believe he will, there will be others on the Tory and Labour backbenchers who may think 'UKIP is for us.'\" Prominent backbenchers Peter Bone, Stewart Jackson and Nadine Dorries are among those to have ruled out a defection to Nigel Farage's party as Eurosceptic Tory MPs rallied round David Cameron. The seaside seat of Clacton's population is older than the national average, and pollsters have found that UKIP's appeal is strongest among the over-60s. Analysis of demographic data by Nottingham University's Matthew Goodwin suggests that Clacton is \"the most favourable seat for UKIP in the country\". In graphics: Will Clacton's voters opt for UKIP? Conservative Eurosceptic John Redwood said talk of eight possible defections was a \"figment of UKIP's imagination\", suggesting that this was merely an estimate of the number of MPs who may have had lunch with Mr Wheeler. \"Dream on UKIP. It is the kind of figure that you would put round if you were UKIP.\" he told Radio 4's Today programme. Among MPs to have ruled out joining UKIP include long-standing EU rebels Mark Pritchard, John Baron, Bill Cash, Bernard Jenkin and Jacob Rees-Mogg. Speaking in Clacton, Mr Carswell said he had a \"phenomenal amount of support\" since announcing his decision, adding there had been a \"real shift in opinion locally\". He added: \"I could lose. There is a risk in this. I am putting my principles on the table.\" A local councillor in Sevenoaks, Kent, has become the first elected representative to defect from the Conservatives to UKIP since Mr Carswell's decision. Chris Neal, who represents the Cowden and Heaver ward on Sevenoaks District Council, said he felt the Conservatives \"no longer have the interests of ordinary people at heart\" and their position on the EU was \"an insult to democracy\". He said he had considered \"staying quiet\" until next May's local elections, when he plans to step down as a councillor, but had been inspired to switch sides by Mr Carswell.", "text": ["The",

patients\". It follows controversial changes in the way 999 calls are prioritised. But like other UK colleagues, Welsh ambulance crews are facing worsening delays in handing over patients when they get to hospital. The statistics from the BBC's freedom of information request revealed that average response times for calls, where a life is judged to be immediately at risk, have improved since a new \"clinical model\" came into force in October last year. In contrast, the trend in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland appears to be in the opposite direction. The changes in Wales saw response-time targets scrapped for all except the most serious cases. Before then, an eight minute target applied to about 40% of calls received by the Welsh Ambulance Service. Now the eight minute target applies to just 4 to 5% of the calls received designated red under the new system. Opposition parties at the time criticised the change as \"moving the goal-posts\" and the Conservatives believe the current categorisation is still too narrow for the most urgent cases. But Health Secretary Vaughan Gething said: \"It's meant we're going after people where that fast response makes a difference. \"And that was the whole point for the change - it's not because it's easier for a politician to do but because there's evidence and advice from leading clinicians that this is the right thing to do for patients.\" The latest performance figures, out on Wednesday, show 77.1% of responses to red calls arrived within eight minutes. The target is 65%. BUT HANDOVER DELAYS ARE INCREASING Despite improvements in response times, the figures showed that ambulance crews face worsening delays outside A&E departments. These are caused when emergency units become full, meaning patients have to wait in an ambulance for beds to become available. When this happens the ambulance and crew cannot respond to other calls. The figures for 2016 are worse for every month compared to the same month last year - despite commitments by health boards to try to tackle the problem. The worst period was in March at the peak of the winter pressures. In total, ambulances have spent more than 40,500 unnecessary hours waiting outside A&E between January and August - nearly as much as for the whole of 2015 already. Sonia Thompson, head of operations for the Welsh Ambulance Service in north Wales, said it was a complicated issue and they were working closely with hospitals and health boards to tackle handover issues. \"We need to understand demand and ensure if someone doesn't need to go to hospital there are alternatives to use,\" she added. Since the new system came into force there has been a significant reduction in Wales in the length of longest waits for an ambulance response and the proportion of the most critical calls taking longer than 12 minutes. Even in the busiest month this year - March - the proportion of red calls taking more than 12 minutes was 16.6%, down from 19% for the same month in 2015. A day in the life of the ambulance service Ambulances in the UK - five ways services are innovating FATHER AND SON ON THE FRONTLINE Osian Roberts is a paramedic with 25 years experience and a team leader at the Welsh Ambulance Service, working out of Llandudno Junction, Conwy county. Driving the ambulance is his son Aron, an emergency medical technician. We spent the day with them - a 12 hour shift, which involved in two cases waits of 20 minutes outside Glan Clwyd waiting to transfer patients. Aron Roberts said: \"The hospitals are starting to fill up slowly now and we're starting to wait a bit longer outside. It's quite frustrating when you have a poorly patient on board and they need hospital treatment - it's difficult just to wait outside and wait for a bed to become available.\" The day before, their ambulance was waiting outside the hospital for up to four hours before patients could be taken in. The other day I went to a lady with swollen knees - she didn't think of seeing a doctor but thought an ambulance would be appropriate \"We can take patients to get scans and X-Rays but it's not our role to do that, it should be the hospital's,\" he said. \"We're sat here thinking someone needs our help and can't do anything, we want to go but we just can't. When I first started I thought I'd be going to road accidents and cardiac arrests but I'm seeing more of the older generation.\" Osian Roberts said the job had changed a great deal. \"When I started more than 25 years ago, it was life or limb emergencies. Now we're going to more calls for chronic illnesses, the work is so much more diverse now,\" he said. But he said there were still too many calls coming in when using a GP or pharmacist might be a better alternative. \"The public need to be educated to choose well before they call the ambulance. Think wisely before you call - there are other options - unless it's a real emergency of course, then call 999,\" he added. \"It's possibly the non-emergency calls which tie us up the most. We still have to turn up, we don't just leave them there, it might be making a call to their GP or getting referred to a specialised unit. It still takes time and takes resources away from the proper emergencies.\" Aron Roberts added: \"The other day I went to a lady with swollen knees - she didn't think of seeing a doctor but thought an ambulance would be appropriate. We're supposed to be for life and death emergencies. \"But since the transition, I've noticed the red calls are genuine red calls - and those who don't need so much of a fast response, we are still getting to them and they are getting the help they need but it's the right resource at the right time for that patient.\" But the Conservatives claimed some patients with potentially serious problems - such as chest pains - might not be getting a quick enough response because the red category was now too narrow. Clwyd West AM Darren Millar said a constituent in Llandudno had to wait 35 minutes for an ambulance after collapsing with a suspected heart attack but he found it was not classified as critical because the patient was not unconscious. Conservative health spokeswoman Angela Burns said: \"The real scandal here is that the Welsh Government only time-targets 4% of ambulance calls, which betrays an incredible lack of accountability, particularly where conditions such as heart attack and stroke depend on the speed of treatment.\" Dr Brendan Lloyd, the Welsh Ambulance Service medical director, said: \"Calls in our amber category are those where the patient requires a blue light response and urgent specialist medical attention - this includes chest pain and stroke. \"For some conditions, like stroke, there is strong evidence to support a specialist treatment within a few hours of the onset of symptoms, rather than minutes.\" Plaid Cymru said the Welsh Government \"could not hide\" behind the statistics which were only recently set and were not comparable as all nations measure urgent calls in different ways. The party's heath spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth AM said paramedics had told him of the stresses of dealing with the 96% of other calls. He added: \"Figures for how many hours ambulances have to wait outside hospitals before patients can be admitted to A&E are alarming. \"The figures published today for 2016 only go up to August and already they're nearly as high as for the whole of 2015.\" Stephen Harrhy, chief ambulance services commissioner for NHS Wales, is responsible for reviewing performance. \"Not only have we seen significant improvement but we've seen that achieved gradually over a period of time,\" he said. \"It has been sustained and that's really important because patients with immediate life-threatening conditions need to get an ambulance as quickly as they can.\" He said the service was working with hospitals to tackle \"complicated\" handover problems. This included a more coordinated winter pressures plan and introducing an immediate vehicle release policy, so ambulances waiting outside hospitals could be back on the road when the service was short of vehicles.", "text": ["The", "health", "secretary", "said", "it", "shows", "a", "``", "better", "service", "with", "a", "better", "outcome", "for", "patients", "''", ".", "It", "follows",

{"raw_text": "And it has some pretty influential backers, including new French President Francois Hollande, Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti, and the President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso. But those that really matter are less keen. The German government has said eurobonds \"don't make sense\" right now, given that individual member states conduct their own economic policies. It is also concerned the introduction of such bonds could reduce the resolve of highly-indebted governments to balance their budgets. There does, however, appear to be a compromise in the works. The Germans seem open to the idea of \"project bonds\" that can be used to finance infrastructure investment across Europe. But what are eurobonds and project bonds (neither of which actually exists yet), and what are the government bonds on which they are based? What is a government bond? Governments borrow money by selling bonds to investors. A bond is an IOU. In return for the investor's cash, the government promises to pay a fixed rate of interest over a specific period - say 4% every year for 10 years. At the end of the period, the investor is repaid the cash they originally paid, cancelling that particular bit of government debt. Government bonds have traditionally been seen as ultra-safe long-term investments and are held by pension funds, insurance companies and banks, as well as private investors. They are a vital way for countries to raise funds. What is a bond market? Once a bond has been issued - and the government has the cash - the investor can hold the bond and collect the interest every year until it is repaid. But investors can also buy and sell bonds that have already been issued on the financial markets - just like buying and selling shares on the stock market. The price of the bond will fluctuate as the outlook for interest rates changes. So, for example, if the markets think that interest rates are going to rise sharply, then the value of a bond paying a fixed rate of 4% for the next 10 years will fall. Bond prices will also fall if investors think that there is a risk of the government that issued the bond not being able to make the annual interest payment or repay it in full on maturity - and these are the fears which have been pushing down Spanish bond prices. What is a bond yield? The bond yield tells the investor what the return on their investment is, and can be calculated based on the current price of the bond in the market. If a 100-euro bond is paying 4% fixed interest - in other words, 4 euros per year - and the bond can be bought for 100 euros, then the yield is 4%. If the bond price falls to 90 euros, then the yield will rise. That's because the investor is still getting paid 4 euros every year, and 100 euros at maturity, which is a much bigger return compared with the 90 euros they must put down to buy the bond. Why do bond markets matter? Because they determine what it costs a government to borrow. When a government wants to raise new money, it issues new bonds, and has to pay an interest rate on those bonds that is acceptable to the market. The yield at which the market is buying and selling a government's existing bonds gives a good indication of how much interest the government would have to pay if it wanted to issue new bonds. So, for example, Spanish 10-year bond yields have risen above 6% in recent years. That means that if the Spanish government wants to borrow new money from the bond market for 10 years, it would have to pay an interest rate on the new bond of more than 6%. So what is a eurobond? A eurobond would operate in exactly the same way as a government bond, except that all 17 member states of the eurozone would collectively guarantee the debt rather than a single government. There are, however, many important questions about how a eurobond might work that remain to be answered. For example, if one government could not pay its share of the bond payments, would the other 16 governments step in and make the payments on its behalf? Would the government that got into trouble be required to prioritise its eurobond payments over its other debts? Would government bonds of the individual member governments continue to exist alongside the eurobonds? Who would decide how to spend the money raised via eurobonds? If individual governments could spend the money, then how much would each government be allowed to borrow using eurobonds and under what conditions? How might a eurobond solve the crisis? During the financial crisis, investors have been much less willing to buy the bonds of troubled southern European countries, and much more willing to buy the bonds of Germany and some other financially stronger countries. That has made it much cheaper for Germany to borrow, and prohibitively expensive for Greece, the Irish Republic and Portugal to borrow. The worry is that Spain and Italy may also find it too expensive to borrow. Introducing eurobonds would level the playing field - all governments would be able to borrow at the same interest rate. Why does Germany object to eurobonds? Germany has three basic objections. First of all, the Germans do not see why they should be on the hook for all of the debts racked up by their southern neighbours, which is what a eurobond would entail. Secondly, it may make it more expensive for Germany to borrow, because markets may consider the eurozone as a whole to be a more risky borrower than the financial strong Germans on their own. Thirdly, and most importantly, the German government is afraid that if they guarantee the debts of their eurozone neighbours, that will simply encourage the southern Europeans to borrow and spend more freely, making their debts even bigger and more unsustainable. What about these \"project bonds\"? The details are unclear, but it seems these would be issued by the European Commission. The borrowed money would be spent by the Commission on infrastructure and other growth-enhancing investments, and would ultimately be responsible for repaying the project bonds. They would be similar to eurobonds to the extent that the EU governments are collectively bound to support the Commission and make sure that it can repay the debts. However, the amount of money involved in the project bonds would be far smaller than what is envisioned by the advocates of eurobonds. The Commission's entire budget is equivalent to about 1% of the EU's GDP, whereas most EU government budgets are equivalent to about 50% of their respective GDPs. Nor would project bonds do anything to reduce the borrowing cost of the southern European governments, although it might help indirectly if markets think that the infrastructure spending by the Commission will significantly help the southern European economies to grow.", "text": ["And", "it", "has", "some", "pretty", "influential", "backers", ",", "including", "new", "French", "President",

22-year-old is suiting up for the Leicester Riders in the British Basketball League. \"When things come up, you run with it and try to make the best of it,\" Ward-Hibbert, who reached number 10 in the junior world rankings, told BBC Sport. \"This is a big opportunity for me and I've got a lot of aspirations - I definitely want to play a lot more and in the coming years be a star and big name for the club. \"I will put all the work I can into being the best I can be and see how far I can get with it.\" Injuries, including a shoulder complaint, coupled with waning motivation and planning for life after professional tennis ultimately led Ward-Hibbert back to the hardwood and a second unlikely shot at professional sport. As a teenager, the Nottinghamshire-born athlete was lauded as one of the nation's finest tennis and basketball prospects. He represented his country in both sports, was named England's best Under-16 player in 2010 and a year later, aged 17, clocked the fastest serve ever recorded at Junior Wimbledon with a 133mph effort. So when he enrolled at Loughborough University, studying sports science and management in 2016, he was easily enticed to lace up his basketball shoes again to join his childhood club, Derby Trailblazers, in the second-tier National Basketball League. It proved to be a career-changing decision, leading to him to a deal with the Riders - a club that has won six pieces of silverware, including two league titles, in the past four seasons. \"It was a crazy process and happened really quickly,\" Ward-Hibbert said. \"I had a tough time with injuries and with it being such a tough sport, motivation kind of came into play. It was tough to take mentally and physically and was frustrating - especially when it was my go-to, my money maker. \"I decided to take some time out to further my education. I was back home so started playing again at Derby, it was good to be around familiar faces. From there it spiralled and here I am.\" While tennis took priority, basketball has always remained a theme in his life - with his other brother pursuing the sport with Minot State University in the United States. On tour, Ward-Hibbert would likely be found shooting hoops if there was a basketball court nearby. And if Australia's Nick Kyrgios was around, going head-to-head with the now world number 15 was common place. \"Everyone would want to play him - Josh was known in the tennis world for his basketball ability,\" said Daniel Kiernan, owner of the SotoTennis Academy and Ward-Hibbert's long-time mentor and coach. \"I saw him plenty of times on the basketball court, that is for sure, and he always looked so comfortable. \"There was definitely a little more confidence about him when he was on a basketball court. You would see it in him when he played doubles tennis as well - it is not an arrogance, but a nice balance of self-assurance and confidence that wasn't always there on the singles court.\" Find out how to get into basketball with our special guide. Standing 196cm tall and weighing 96kg, Ward-Hibbert turned heads as a fine physical specimen in tennis. Even from an early age, he stood out. \"Just looking at him, seeing him play grabbed your attention,\" said Paul Hutchins, the former Davis Cup captain who also previously worked as head of men's tennis at the Lawn Tennis Association. \"It is a loss to tennis because he is a young man that had promise. He must be one of the best athletes in British tennis - his size, speed and shape. \"Basketball is lucky to have him.\" On the way to breaking into the top 10 as a junior player, Ward-Hibbert graced the courts of each of the Grand Slams in 2012 - finishing at the junior US Open at Flushing Meadows. \"When you are at the Slams, people are asking for your autograph, they probably don't know who you are, but it makes you feel important,\" he said. \"I liked that.\" At the same time, he was trying to establish himself as a professional - playing on the third-tier Futures Tour and flying 808 places up the world rankings in 11 months to reach a career-best 305 in November 2013. But even though making the transition to promising professional was a demanding one - chasing ranking points in a globetrotting expedition from Casablanca to Ho Chi Minh City - Ward-Hibbert was very much living the dream. \"Growing up, I always had those aspirations to be a professional,\" he said. \"At 19 I took that route. \"I'd love to have made a profession of it, been a top-100 player, it would have been amazing, I would have loved it. \"I gave it a lot of effort and a lot of time and I don't have any hard feeling about the sport. It is brutal. It is not like I fell out of love with the sport, I still love playing and will play when I can.\" Even after turning his attention to basketball and studies, he made the most of his first opportunity to get back on the tennis court - reaching the semi-finals of a Futures tournament at Loughborough. \"I will still be about,\" he said. \"You will see me, if there is a tournament locally and I have some time on my hands, I will be flying to it to get a couple of serves down.\" While Kiernan is convinced Ward-Hibbert is capable of having a playing or coaching career in tennis in the future, the sporting switch has filled him with \"an overriding sense of pride\". Kiernan, who has run a tennis academy in Sotogrande in Spain since 2010, said: \"It is fantastic that he has two sports where he is so accomplished and passionate about. \"It is about him being happy and finding something that he can really throw himself into.\" Ward-Hibbert readily admits he has much to learn in basketball and a lot of catching up to do, joining a team that includes former Great Britain captain Drew Sullivan, but he insists his tennis background will hold him in good stead. \"Sure, it is a different sport but the mindset, the professionalism; all sports require similar qualities,\" he said. Riders coach Rob Paternostro, who hopes his newest recruit will help him improve his own tennis game, is excited by Ward-Hibbert's talent. \"The potential is there and we are always looking for British talent to mould for the future,\" Paternostro said. \"He is a little raw at the moment, no question, but we see a lot of his skills are there. We need to polish him up a little. \"You see the athleticism there and to get to where he got in the tennis world, you know he is determined and willing to do what it takes to make it.\"", "text":

{"raw_text": "Amid chaotic scenes, police ordered journalists from the scene at Bicske, declaring it an \"operation zone\". The train had left Budapest hours after police let migrants into the railway station following a two-day stand-off. Meanwhile, there have been sharp disagreements among European leaders over how to deal with the crisis. As it happened: Thursday's developments In Brussels, Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban described the situation as a \"German problem\" as Germany was where those arriving in the EU \"would like to go\". But European Council President Donald Tusk said at least 100,000 refugees should be distributed across EU states. In other developments on Thursday: The human cost of the crisis was put into sharp focus on Wednesday when five children were among 12 migrants who drowned in Turkish waters while trying to reach Greece. Images of the washed-up body of three-year-old Alan Kurdi, who died alongside his mother and five-year-old brother, circulated widely on social media. Will image of dead child change views? Drowned boy denied Canadian asylum Syrian reaction to Alan Kurdi images Drowned boy's father tells of ordeal Alan Kurdi: A family forced to flee Earlier on Thursday, migrants who had been camped outside Budapest's Keleti railway station surged on to the platforms as soon as police withdrew. Nothing illustrates how difficult this crisis is to resolve than what has happened to these several hundred refugees who are currently on this train at Bicske. There were some police on board. We got as far as Bicske and when the train pulled in, there were loads of police waiting for them on the platform. The plan seemed to be to take them to a centre where they would be properly identified. Some people left the first carriage, but almost immediately there was resistance. A lot of people were banging on the windows - some were shouting \"Germany! Germany!\" The police put on riot gear. Some refugees who had been taken off the train began pushing and jostling and there was a little bit of fighting with riot police. And then they forced their way back on the train, which is where we are at the moment with police on the platform and several hundred refugees on the train. UK 'will fulfil moral responsibilities' Migrant crisis in graphics Volunteers step up Hungary lays bare EU East-West split International services were suspended at Budapest's station but hundreds crammed on to the first train hoping it would take them to the Austrian border. Instead, the train stopped at the Hungarian town of Bicske about 40km (25 miles) west of Budapest which hosts a major refugee camp, and police lined the platforms. Some migrants at first left the train but then forced their way back on when they realised where the authorities wanted them to go. They fear that registering at the camp will make it harder for them to seek asylum in Germany and other countries. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is a political leader who thrives on conflict. While he tolerates no dissent within his Fidesz party, he enjoys taking on his opponents. But in the refugee crisis now overwhelming Hungary, he is attacking not only the migrants themselves, but, increasingly, Germany. Mr Orban himself has described proposals for binding quotas of refugees to be accepted by all EU countries as \"idiotic\" - a personal insult to Chancellor Angela Merkel. His game now seems to be two-fold: to stir up xenophobia at home by appearing both patriotic and powerful and to reach out to anti-migrant opinion across Europe. Back in Budapest, about 2,000 migrants are still camped outside the Keleti station with more in nearby John Paul II square and at Nyugati railway station across the city. \"I think (the train) was a trick by the government, the police and the train company, \" said Marton Bisztrai, a volunteer at Keleti. \"The train looked like it was going to Germany.\" Five obstacles to an EU migrants deal Those who risk everything for a better life Global failure to help Syrian refugees The number of migrants entering Europe has reached record levels this year. Germany expects to take in 800,000 asylum seekers this year - four times last year's total. The surge in numbers has created tension and disagreement over EU migration policy. Germany has been prepared to accept large numbers of asylum seekers, but other countries have not. During a tense press conference in Brussels with European Parliament President Martin Schulz, Mr Orban, who heads the anti-immigration Fidesz party, said Hungarians \"were full of fear because they see that the European leaders... are not able to control the situation\". \"Nobody would like to stay in Hungary, neither in Slovakia nor Poland nor Estonia. All of them would like to go to Germany. Our job is only to register them,\" he said. Mr Tusk took Mr Orban to task for saying in a newspaper interview that Hungary was being \"overrun\" with refugees who threatened to undermine Europe's Christian roots. \"Referring to Christianity in a public debate on migration must mean in the first place the readiness to show solidarity and sacrifice,\" he said. Mr Tusk's call for at least 100,000 asylum seekers to be redistributed across EU states is a sharp increase on a previous European Commission target of 40,000. The word migrant is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as \"one who moves, either temporarily or permanently, from one place, area, or country of residence to another\". A refugee is, according to the 1951 Refugee Convention, any person who \"owing to a well-founded fear\" of persecution is outside their country of nationality and \"unable\" or \"unwilling\" to seek the protection of that country. To gain the status, one has to go through the legal process of claiming asylum. The word migrant has traditionally been considered a neutral term, but some criticise the BBC and other media for using a word they say implies something voluntary, and should not be applied to people fleeing danger.

Not those of the United States, Japan, India or much of the European Union. They've declined the invitation. But this weekend Mr Xi is gathering all the presidents and prime ministers he can muster in Beijing, hoping to inspire them with a vision about China as a force for good in the world. Xi Jinping came to power five years ago with a determination that China should stop hiding its light under a bushel. Instead of creeping up timidly on the world order, he felt it should walk tall as a mighty and ancient civilisation which had gone from marginal economic player to the world's biggest trading nation in less than four decades. \"The relationship between China and the rest of the world is undergoing historic changes. Tell China stories well,\" he urged the nation's media, diplomats and think tanks, adding that they must present China as a builder of world peace and contributor to global development. This weekend he himself takes the stage as storyteller in chief at Beijing's Belt and Road Forum. It helps that there is currently no competing global narrative from the United States or the European Union, as President Trump turns inward to \"Make America Great Again\" and the EU struggles with Brexit and a slew of other challenges. China's underlying narrative is well known to all Mr Xi's guests. Economic transformation and breakneck growth have returned it to its traditional position at the centre of the East Asian economy. And now Mr Xi wants to use Chinese money and construction might to rebuild much of Eurasia's infrastructure of ports, roads and rails and put China at its heart. A giant exercise in joining the dots whose buzzword is connectivity. Critics in Washington, Tokyo and New Delhi observe that some of the biggest belt and road projects seem to be for strategically significant assets. Like the oil and gas pipelines across Central Asia, and the Indian Ocean ports in Pakistan and Sri Lanka which might serve military as well as commercial uses. Many observers see an obvious geopolitical agenda to the belt and road initiative, but in a suspicious and prickly neighbourhood China firmly denies it. To make the plan less threatening, it frames it as a revival of the ancient Silk Road whose camel caravans carried Chinese goods west across Asia more than 1,000 years ago. The aim is a soft-power message of a China which is mighty but peaceful, delivering what it can to the world in exchanges of mutual benefit. But the belt and road is much more ambitious than a camel caravan. By land and by sea, through transport networks, telecoms, energy pipelines and industrial hubs, it promises to integrate more than 60 countries and 60% of the world's population. And for domestic Chinese audiences, the story of the belt and road is told with a different emphasis, focusing less on the wins for foreigners and more on opportunities for China's impoverished west and assisting China's push up the value chain into industries like high speed rail and nuclear power. There's even a narrative aimed at foreign children. Mr Xi may be the headline act on stage this weekend but in the scramble to offer the warm up, the state-owned China Daily newspaper is running online videos of an American father telling his daughter bedtime stories about the belt and road as \"China's idea which belongs to the world\". And in a catchy music video, ukulele strumming multi-ethnic children surrounded by cut-out camels sing the praises of the belt and road. \"We're paving new roads, building more ports, finding new options with friends of all sorts, It's a culture exchange, we trade in our wealth, we connect with our hearts, it strengthens our health,\" it goes. Mr Xi has been telling the belt and road story for four years now. Why gather the world's decision makers in Beijing for a grand rendition now? One short answer is that he needs to drum up growth. China's domestic economy is slowing and exporting Chinese construction capacity to the belt and road would help boost the domestic economy in the short and medium term. If even some of the infrastructure projects succeed, they might in turn contribute to growth in the long term by spurring demand from China's neighbours. But a more personal reason for the timing is Mr Xi's own political cycle. In the one-party state, being Communist Party leader is more important than being president and this year China will hold a vital Party Congress. Hosting the world this weekend burnishes Xi Jinping's aura of invincibility by reminding his party and public that he is increasing China's clout on the international stage. A third reason for the timing is the international picture. Many of America's friends and allies in the region were dismayed by Mr Trump's decision to walk away from the TPP trade agreement, an agreement which his predecessor had said was vital to the US setting the rules of the road in Asia rather than letting China set them. Mr Xi's new push for the belt and road initiative is the same kind of canny political opportunism that spurred his defence of globalisation at the Davos forum in January. So China's president has been lucky in his timing and bold in seizing the stage. And it will certainly look to his guests as if he usually gets what he wants. No country puts on a grand spectacle of purpose and progress quite like China does. This weekend Beijing's sky will be blue. Smog, traffic snarl and ghost towns littered with white elephant infrastructure will be safely far from view. This is the show and tell of Xi Jinping's story\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 China the can-do master builder inspiring awe in all beholders and giving hope that what China has achieved at home it might replicate elsewhere. But the truth is that Mr Xi's will works as an organising principle only for some of the people some of the time, and usually only for a very small number of highly specific objectives. Even in Beijing, the sky is not always blue, the traffic is often snarled and resources are often misallocated. How much more is this true beyond the glittering capital. China is an economy with a perilous debt overhang precisely because its investors are just as fallible as those of other countries. Yes, on the right project and for the right price, Chinese money and Chinese master builders can work infrastructure wonders. But that was always the case. The belt and road is an important initiative, but one of indeterminate boundaries, duration and outcome. Mr Xi's guests should not make the mistake of thinking all Chinese players will do his bidding and all bedtime stories will come true.", "text": ["But", "first", "he", "'s", "going", "to", "try",

of internet surveillance powers, which the government believes are critical to the fight against terrorism, organised crime and online paedophilia. But because it has to be through Parliament before the end of December, its opponents have a great deal of leverage against it. The reasons lie in the long backstory behind this latest bill; first, there was the Communications Data Bill, which was dropped by the coalition, after a savaging from a joint committee of MPs and peers. Then there was the compromise measure DRIPA, the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act, which only got through Parliament after a \"sunset clause\" was added, under which many of the powers it granted would expire at the end of the year. Today in Parliament from Friday 4 March Which explains the urgency around the Investigatory Powers Act, because a new law has to be in place, to ensure current powers don't lapse after that December deadline. The bill would provide an armoury of new powers - as the Home Secretary, Theresa May, told Parliament, it would give powers to \"law enforcement, the security and intelligence agencies and the armed forces to acquire the content of communications or communications data. These include the ability to retain and acquire communications data to be used as evidence in court and to advance investigations; the ability to intercept the contents of communications in order to acquire sensitive intelligence to tackle terrorist plots and serious and organised crimes; the use of equipment interference powers to obtain data covertly from computers; and the use of these powers by the security and intelligence agencies in bulk to identify the most serious threats to the UK from overseas and to rapidly establish links between suspects in the UK.\" To many civil libertarians the proposed powers are unacceptably intrusive, and at the very least extremely powerful safeguards need to be in place around them - the government is offering a \"double lock\" requiring both the home secretary and a judge to sign off on interception warrants. This is the kind of issue which could unite Labour (mostly, anyway; there are senior figures with worried about appearing soft on terror), the SNP and the Lib Dems, as well as the modest group of Tory critics around uber-awkward squaddie, David Davis. We will get an early indication of how co-ordinated these groups are, and how hard they intend to fight on Tuesday at the second reading debate. There are unlikely to be actual votes against the bill, because no-one wants to be accused of being soft on crime and terrorism, but there could well be abstentions, and some parties could even whip their MPs to abstain. More time? And there may also be a bit of action around the programme motion; so big and so significant is this bill, that there are calls for it to be given an unusually long report stage, to allow MPs to propose detailed changes. There is already talk of a two-day report stage; some critics argue for four, and their demands could well be put to a vote. The real moment of Commons danger will probably come during that report stage (however many days are devoted to it) when cross-party amendments are likely on a range of issues. Again, these are likely to be presented in terms of what is most effective in fighting terrorism and organised crime; there is an argument, for example, that bulk data collection powers result in the security services or the police trying to find a needle in a much larger haystack. It is probably too early to identify exactly what issues will be pushed - but this is one of those rare measures which might bring together a Commons majority against the government. And it will test the powers of the ministerial team behind the bill - John Hayes, the Security Minister, and Robert Buckland, the Solicitor-General, as well as of the government whips. A crucial factor in all this is the slightly unlikely, but very real alliance, between Labour's Deputy Leader, Tom Watson, and David Davis, which combines two hardened Commons street-fighters. In fact they may get in an early blow, if they succeed in challenging some of the data retention powers in the European Court. A ruling in their favour there could gut a major part of this bill. Lords' concerns And all this is before the bill arrives in the House of Lords, where, of course, the government does not have even a theoretical majority. And the problem for ministers there is that if the bill is to become law by that December deadline, there simply is not the time to override unwelcome Lords amendments by means of the Parliament Act, which gives peers considerable leverage to force the government to compromise. One possible deal would be to pass a mini-bill simply extending the existing DRIPA powers, while allowing much longer for Parliament to ponder the rest of the Investigatory Powers Bill. But the Security Minister, John Hayes, told me on Radio 4's Today in Parliament, last week, that that would be a \"soft option\" and noted that there had been extensive consideration of the bill in draft, by three different select committees, so the issues were hardly new to MPs or peers. But he's clearly braced for a rough few months.", "text": ["The", "Investigatory", "Powers", "Bill", "-", "the", "new", "``", "Snoopers", "'", "Charter", "''", "to", "its", "critics", "-", "is",

own reputation as Labour's most disobedient MP? Whips have been maintaining party discipline and encouraging MPs to vote for the party line since the 18th Century. The whips' office is a bit like the engine of a car: it generates the power needed to get the vehicle to the places the driver wants it to go. A notoriously secretive and mysterious bunch, they don't reveal much about their work. But the BBC managed to talk to some former whips about what it was like trying to keep Mr Corbyn in line when he was at his most disobedient. \"Frankly we didn't spend a lot of time bothering,\" says Jacqui Smith, who served as Tony Blair's chief whip between 2006 and 2007. \"There were some people for whom it was simply not worth the effort, and he was one of them.\" Baroness Armstrong had an eventful time as chief whip between 2001 and 2006. She had to deal with revolts over issues such as foundation hospitals, tuition fees and the Iraq war - Mr Corbyn voted against his party on all three. Speaking about how the whips' encounters with Mr Corbyn went during these years, she says: \"To whip, he was dead easy. \"He was always polite and always told you what he was going to do. But he never wanted to engage in the debate or the argument. \"Politics is about compromise, and he never wanted to be put in a position where he was expected to compromise.\" Whips get their name from hunting terminology. The term \"whipper in\" refers to the rider who cracks the whip to keep straying hounds together in a pack during a chase The earliest recorded usage of the term in the political context is on 18 November 1742: Heneage Finch remarked in a letter to Lord Malton that \"the Whigs for once in their lives have whipped in better than the Tories\". During 13 years of Labour government - between 1997 and 2010 - Mr Corbyn was the party's most rebellious MP, defying his party's whip 428 times Last week, he suffered the first Commons rebellion of his leadership as 21 of his MPs refused to vote against the government's new fiscal rules. Nottingham University's Prof Phil Cowley has interviewed Mr Corbyn on several occasions for his books on backbench rebellions. He recalls how the new Labour leader once told him that he rebelled on only three issues - war and peace, social and economic policy and matters of liberty. \"I pointed out to him that covered everything government does,\" says Prof Cowley. Mr Corbyn's past behaviour looks set to come back to haunt him now he needs the loyalty of Labour MPs. Backbench MP Mike Gapes, who has represented the Ilford South constituency for Labour since 1992, told the BBC: \"Jeremy Corbyn can't expect me to be any more loyal to the Labour Party under his leadership than he was to the leadership of Neil Kinnock, John Smith, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, Margaret Beckett, Harriet Harman or Ed Miliband.\" There could be trouble if the new leader tries to change party policy on issues including Nato, the European Union, defence and military action in Syria, says the MP. Mr Gapes hasn't caused whips any sleepless nights in the past, but is now clear that he will go his own way when he disagrees with his party leader. \"I'm going to vote according to my conscience and the manifesto and the pledges I gave to my constituents, and if there is a sudden change of approach from my party leadership and I am expected to vote against my views, or the policy on which I have a mandate that I was elected on, then I won't do it.\" New Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley, Jess Phillips, says that Mr Corbyn can count on her loyalty \"at the moment\" but that she will examine issues \"on a case-by-case basis\". Mr Corbyn has called for a more honest and democratic approach to politics. As one of Labour's most outspoken MPs, has Ms Phillips found she is easily able to communicate her views to the leader? \"He gives me a lot of opportunities to talk to him and his team,\" she says. But for Ms Phillips the jury is still out: \"He always listens - whether listening turns to action is yet to be seen.\" The Birmingham MP is known for her rows on Twitter with shadow international development secretary and strong supporter of Mr Corbyn, Diane Abbott. Last week, the Labour whips' office took the unusual step of tweeting the names of MPs who defied the party's position on the government's new fiscal rules - Mr Corbyn's first major discipline problem as leader. What does Ms Phillips make of this party discipline by social media? She says Ms Abbott should adopt a more cordial approach if she wants to win people over to Mr Corbyn's cause: \"I think that if Diane wants us to get behind Jeremy, so far she's clumsily gone about it the wrong way. \"Her intentions are to command loyalty to Jeremy, but her actions to date do the opposite. She should try love-bombing.\" The Labour leadership has signalled that it could offer a \"free vote\" on issues such as military action in Syria and the renewal of Britain's nuclear weapons programme. A free vote is where MPs are not instructed to vote a certain way by their party and they are usually reserved for matters of conscience. Prof Cowley questions the point of having political parties if they do not take stances on fundamental issues. \"A free vote on something like Trident or the war in Syria is effectively her majesty's opposition saying it doesn't have a stance on it,\" he told the BBC. \"That to me is quite tricky, and a remarkable shift in what parties exist for. \"Parties are supposed to exist as an aggregate of interests and allow voters to say why they like this party, or that party. That's why mass suffrage led to mass disciplined parties. It was seen as important to accountability.\" By contrast, philosopher and free will advocate Julian Baggini says it's time for a more honest and direct politics and that the \"out of date and unnecessary\" whipping system should be scrapped altogether. \"All they whips do is reinforce the public perception that MPs are serving their own interests and those of their party - not those of the electorate,\" he explains. \"It's treating MPs like children who will only co-operate with each other if you force them to.\" Mr Baggini argues that there's an opportunity in giving politicians more freedom, in that the party will be seen to be made up of people of independent minds and genuine convictions. Soon enough Mr Corbyn could be forced to choose between his promise of a new \"kinder politics\" or resorting to the traditional arm-twisting ways of the whips to ensure his MPs do as they are told.",

it got much more than just an internet-connected thermostat and smoke detector. It got the man dubbed the \"the iPod's father\" - the engineer/designer who sold Steve Jobs on his vision of a portable music player, and then worked alongside Jony Ive to build it, update it and then repeat the process with the iPhone. Now, the two men are set to go head-to-head. First with wearable tech, and then later, perhaps, with competing car designs - more of which later. Tellingly, Mr Fadell reveals he recently started testing Sir Jonathan's latest product, the Apple Watch, although he was not wearing it at the time of interview. \"I've had mine for about two weeks now,\" he says. \"I think they did a tremendous job on the hardware components of it. \"They are trying many different things with that platform - some are going to be great, and some are not.\" When Mr Fadell agreed to sell Nest to Google, the reason he gave was that joining forces would accelerate his \"thoughtful home\" master plan - he hates the term \"internet of things\", which he says does a \"disservice\" to his products. But in January, it became clear that Google's chief executive, Larry Page, had wider uses for his hardware expertise, and the troubled Glass computer was added to his duties. \"It wasn't handed to me and said, 'Tony clean it up,'\" Mr Fadell clarifies, \"I offered.\" \"I remember what it was like when we did the iPod and the iPhone. I think this can be that important, but it's going to take time to get it right.\" The $1,500 (\u00c2\u00a3965) \"explorer edition\" of Glass was soon pulled from sale, and Mr Fadell made clear that future test versions would be kept in-house. That was widely seen as a shift in strategy for Google - a company that took five years to take its Gmail service out of \"beta\" status, and that still invites users to \"play\" with preview versions of other products. Moreover, it caused anger among developers who had sunk time and money into making apps for a product that no longer existed. But Mr Fadell defends the shift, saying a distinction needed to be drawn between hardware and software. \"If you are only doing services based on electrons, you can iterate quickly, test it, and modify it and get it right,\" he says. \"But when you are dealing with actual atoms - hardware - and you have to get manufacturing lines and it takes a year or more to develop that product, you better understand what it is and what it's trying to do and specifically what it's not going to do. \"Customers have to spend money to buy those atoms. \"They want something that delivers value or you end up with a real disappointment and you can spoil the market.\" For now, that leaves Mr Fadell's reputation dependent on his Nest line-up. It is limited to three products, including the recently launched Nest Cam. The motion-detecting camera streams live footage and sound from the owner's home to an app and can save memorable moments in the cloud. If you get over the creepiness factor of effectively spying on your family, it's fair to say the device shares the crisp, stylish look of the Nest's other products, and reviews have been positive. But the camera is actually an upgrade to an earlier device made by Dropcam - a company Nest acquired. That means Mr Fadell's division has not created a new product category of its own since joining Google. Bearing in mind, Mr Page told him to \"keep doing what you're doing, and do it as fast as you possibly can\", it raises the question: what's taking so long? \"Talk to me about the number of home product companies who have come out with three different product categories in less than five years... are shipping and they are the number ones in their category,\" says Mr Fadell, slightly bristling. \"I would love to have more, faster. \"But it takes time - it really takes time to make these products to the level of design and near-perfection that we achieve.\" He adds that Nest's biggest goal right now is to expand the range of third-party products its devices talk to - for example its Thermostats can switch LG fridges into energy-saving mode when no-one's in, and its Protect sensors can make Philip's Hue lights flash red if they detect smoke or carbon monoxide. But such advances have less impact than a new product. \"Despite his substantial success to date and involvement in key products such as Apple iPod, Mr Fadell has arguably not yet reached the truly iconic status bestowed upon Jonathan Ive,\" Ben Wood, from the tech consultancy CCS Insight, says. \"Given the huge amount Google invested in the acquisition of Nest to secure his services there must be an expectation that he too can deliver his own portfolio of truly disruptive devices with mass appeal. \"Google still lacks a smash-hit consumer electronics device of its own - it would be sensible to assume it hopes Mr Fadell can deliver that missing element.\" The two men worked together on first iPods and iPhones, but are credited with different achievements. With the iPod, Mr Fadell first convinced Steve Jobs of the wisdom of developing a portable music player and then worked out how to incorporate a hard drive - a fragile component - into a device that could be thrown about, sat on and generally abused. Jony Ive's breakthrough was his design of its thumb-wheel, which scrolled through songs more rapidly as it was spun more quickly. With the iPhone, perhaps Mr Fadell's greatest feat was finding a way to shrink the tech necessary to offer a multi-touch user interface on a handheld device. Jony Ive's skill was best summed up by one writer as making the final product look almost more like \"a piece of jewellery than a gadget\". In post-Jobs Apple, Sir Jonathan's influence has grown further - extending to the look of the company's operating system software, the creation of its Watch and even the design of its new headquarters. By contrast, Mr Fadell has thrived beyond - building and selling a multi-billion dollar company, reinventing mundane household devices as desirable gadgets, and becoming one of Google's key figures. This leads to thoughts about whether Mr Fadell could become involved in other Google projects. A question about working on its growing roster of robots is rebuffed on the grounds that they are still a long way from leaving the lab. But self-driving cars, he adds, are much closer to launch and a \"big curiosity\". \"I don't think you've seen anything of what the design of the car could look like when it first materialises,\" he says. \"How do you make those occupants feel like they are safe and make sure they are safe? \"How does the car exude safety and be fashionable as well? \"How does this 'utility' self-driving car also be a reflection of you, right, as well as itself and also be transparent about its safety? \"Those are very interesting questions that still need to be dealt with.\" He adds that he has \"some thoughts\" about the answers and is sharing them with others involved in Google's self-driving car project. \"We are having discussion about them all the time,\" he says. \"I always have ideas - it's whether or not people want to hear them.\" So, nothing official yet. But it would not be a surprise if Google eventually announces Mr Fadell is adding automobile design to his list of duties. And if, as rumoured, Sir Jonathan and his team are also working on their own electric car concept, that could set up a fascinating clash between the two former colleagues in the future.", "text":

nationals. Labour says it will not continue its opposition, including over the issue of a vote on the final Brexit deal. This came as MPs voted overwhelmingly to overturn the Lords amendments. MPs rejected calls for the government to protect the status of EU nationals within three months of the start of Brexit talks by 335 votes to 287 and then dismissed calls for Parliament to have a meaningful vote on any Brexit deal by 331 to 286 votes. Labour peers have said they will not vote to reinsert the provisions, meaning a period of what is known as \"parliamentary ping-pong\" between the elected chamber and its unelected counterpart is highly unlikely. Conceding defeat, Labour's leader in the Lords Baroness Smith, told the BBC they had \"done their best\" in the face of what she claimed was the government's \"pure stubbornness\" but she said for the Lords to continue its opposition when the views of MPs were clear would be an \"empty gesture\". Crossbench peer Lord Pannick said \"it was time to give way\" to the elected chamber. As peers gathered to consider their position. the Lib Dems accused Labour of \"giving up\" and said they would continue to \"fight until the end of the process\" - forcing a fresh vote on the status of EU nationals in the UK. Both Houses of Parliament have to agree the text of the bill before it can be sent for Royal Assent and become law. Prime Minister Theresa May could then theoretically trigger Article 50, which formally starts the Brexit process, as early as Tuesday. However, Downing Street sources have said this will not happen this week and the PM is expected to wait until the end of the month to officially notify the EU of the UK's intention to leave. Only two Tory MPs - Tania Mathias and Alex Chalk - defied the whip over the issue of EU nationals as the government won the first vote comfortably, aided by six Labour MPs who backed Theresa May. There were no rebels in the second vote although 11 Tories abstained, including former cabinet ministers Nicky Morgan, Dominic Grieve and Anna Soubry. Opening Monday's Commons debate, Brexit Secretary David Davis said MPs had already approved the bill \"without any strings attached\" and putting it into law \"without further delay\" would enable the negotiations to begin. He said the government was committed to a \"quick deal\" on the rights of EU residents, but insisted guarantees must be reciprocal. He repeated the government's verbal assurances that both Houses would have a vote on any Brexit deal, but warned that while the Lords amendment \"has been badged as a meaningful vote, the reality is there are some who would seek to use this to overturn the result of the referendum\". \"We will not have anything that will put the intention to leave the EU in doubt,\" he told MPs. But he was pressed by a number of Tory MPs over the exact nature of the parliamentary vote they've been promised. Former minister Anna Soubry said it was \"perverse\" that if the UK and EU were not able to agree a deal at all, that Parliament would not be \"entitled\" to pass its judgement. \"I would urge the government, for the sake of bringing unity to the country at large, that they allow Parliament's sovereignty to reign and in the event of no deal we have a vote and a say,\" she said. For Labour, shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said there was a \"compelling case\" to give EU residents the certainty they deserved, arguing that \"not only is it the right thing do in principle but it would set the right tone ahead of the negotiations\". Former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg accused ministers of \"shameful inaction\" on the issue, while Green Party leader Caroline Lucas said MPs \"were not elected to be lemmings\" in the Brexit process. The SNP's Stephen Gethins said the question of the future of EU residents \"went to the heart of what kind of country we want to be\" and warned MPs not to hand the government a \"blank cheque\" in upcoming talks. But the government won the backing of the vast majority of Tory MPs, including Dudley South's Mike Wood, who had been unable to vote during previous stages of the bill after being hospitalised with sepsis. He tweeted: \"I'm still recovering from sepsis but I was determined to vote to make sure that the decision taken in last June's referendum is implemented.\" Mrs May has said Parliament will get a vote, but some MPs and peers want a stronger commitment to give them a more \"meaningful\" say - and to be able to potentially send her back to the negotiating table in Brussels. Mrs May has said she would rather take the UK out of the EU with no deal rather than a \"bad deal\". No deal would result in trade rules defaulting to World Trade Organisation standards, meaning the UK and EU would be obliged to apply to each other the tariffs and other trade restrictions they apply to the rest of the world.", "text": ["The", "EU", "Withdrawal", "Bill", "is", "set", "to", "be", "passed", "after", "peers", "voted", "by", "273", "votes", "to", "135", "not", "to", "challenge",

now exists at the top of world football. And yet, because we have become so conditioned, so numb, to the years of scandal, deceit and theft, instinct prevents us from assuming anything. What appears truly momentous turns out to be merely incremental. So could this be the moment, once and for all, that things actually change? A tipping point? Or yet another false dawn? Little wonder that some are cautious. For most people, watching events from afar, Blatter left office five months ago, when he announced he would be stepping down. I remember the now-familiar dash to Zurich that June evening, the world's media descending on Fifa HQ to herald a fresh start, a new era. The recovery - it appeared - would now begin. But Blatter stayed, clinging grimly on. Even with Swiss criminal proceedings opened against him, Fifa sponsors demanding he disappear, and now with him finally banished from office altogether, the 79-year-old refuses to give up or admit defeat. He has appealed, claimed his innocence, insisted he was not afforded due process, and could even return to office a few days before February's presidential election having served his suspension. An election which, with most of the leading candidates now banned, could yet be postponed. Since June, a battle of wills has been raging between those who believe world football's governing body should be given the benefit of the doubt and allowed the chance to self-regulate, and the critics, who insist that, even if a reformist such as Prince Ali of Jordan becomes president, the governing body simply cannot be trusted long-term. They say it has proved itself not fit for purpose, and must be told what to do. Never has the latter argument felt quite so compelling. Because football's administrators, it seems, will never learn. Let us consider the case of Platini. Platini has vowed to clear his name, and denies any wrongdoing. But after all of that, and given how obviously football is crying out for a fresh start, one might have expected him to have withdrawn his candidacy to become Fifa president. To do what some would regard as the honourable thing in the wider interests of the game. Instead, the former France international raged against the disciplinary process, condemning the allegations as \"astonishingly vague\", and submitted his candidacy papers anyway in a mood of \"staunch defiance\". In a bizarre statement, he hinted at being the victim of a conspiracy \"to taint a lifelong devotee of the game\", and described his suspension as \"farcical\". Farcical? What is really farcical, perhaps, is Platini's inability to appreciate that, regardless of his innocence or otherwise, merely by association he is tainted whether he likes it or not. What is also farcical, arguably, is the Football Association's refusal to withdraw their support for the beleaguered Frenchman, a decision which former sports minister Hugh Robertson has urged the governing body to rethink quickly. All this, let us remember, at a time when IOC president Thomas Bach has called on Fifa to be open to an \"external presidential candidate of high integrity\" to lead football forward into a new era. This weekend, journalists were directed by Platini's advisers towards the support he retains from Conmebol. Four of the South American confederation's former senior officials are among nine Fifa personnel indicted on corruption charges by US prosecutors. Maybe Platini should think twice before shouting about that support. One senior member of the Government told me this weekend that they were bemused by the FA's loyalty to Platini, and FA chairman Greg Dyke will be asked to explain himself to MPs in two weeks' time when he appears before the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee in Parliament. He will be asked why the FA backed the Uefa president before he had even issued a manifesto, and before waiting to see which other candidates may be running. The FA have their reasons for backing Platini - as outlined in a previous blog - and obviously they could not have foreseen his suspension when declaring their support. But they leave themselves open to suggestions they have lost the moral high-ground that Dyke fought hard to win in Sao Paulo last year - when he led a European rebellion against Blatter - and by FA vice-chairman David Gill in May, when he refused to take his seat on the Fifa Exco in protest at the president's latest re-election. On Thursday, Uefa will hold an emergency meeting in Nyon to discuss whether an alternative candidate to Platini should be considered, and whether to push for a postponement of the Fifa presidential election. Such a move could give Platini more time to clear his name, but could risk giving Blatter a chance to launch an audacious bid to stay in power - assuming Swiss criminal prosecutors do not charge him with any wrongdoing before then. In the meantime, while football's politicians try to work out how on earth to plot a path through this mess, the rest of us are left to consider what should happen to Fifa. What is certain is that Blatter's departure does not in any way suggest the job is done. The fact that Issa Hayatou, a man reprimanded in 2011 by the IOC over bribery allegations - which he denies - is now acting president, proves that. In a bid to police itself, the organisation currently has two reform programmes being worked on - by its audit and compliance chief Domenico Scala, and Swiss lawyer Francois Carrard, respectively - but many believe Fifa has lost the right to police itself, and demand an entirely independent reform commission. Various suggestions deserve consideration: Some want to go much further, urging the Swiss government - recently emboldened by new laws designed to clampdown on the many international sports bodies based there - to put Fifa into state control, seize its assets, wind it up and start again. Others, such as the International Centre for Sport Security, have suggested the establishment of a global body dedicated to good governance and integrity - the equivalent to the World Anti-Doping Agency - overseeing a neutral regulatory platform or code that all sports governing bodies are accountable to. Some may naturally ask where the money for such a concept would come from, but given the vast fortunes the sports industry now generates, surely it cannot be impossible. What seems certain is that this is Fifa's ground zero, and a chance to rebuild that must not be squandered.", "text": ["After", "so", "many", "years", "of", "corruption", ",", "and", "with", "so",

Ofcom has now begun the formal process of forcing a legal split. The big question is what will it all mean for consumers. The argument for separation centres around whether the firm that provides the vast majority of the UK's broadband infrastructure (Openreach) should be part of the same parent group as one of the UK's leading internet service provides (BT). Rivals have long argued that this is bad for competition and the consumer. TalkTalk's Dido Harding was one of the first to welcome Ofcom's new tough stance: \"Openreach has been letting consumers down for far too long, unable to meet promises of even minor improvements and becoming a household name for all the wrong reasons.\" Ofcom agrees and, now too, does the government: \"We've been clear that we need a more independent Openreach. It needs to offer genuinely fair and equal access to the country's telecoms infrastructure to BT's competitors,\" said a spokesman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. This is the best way to ensure consumers get the service they need, and the country gets the digital infrastructure it needs,\" he added. Slow and non-existent broadband is still an issue in remote areas and most agree that is unacceptable in an age where telecoms are as important as gas, electricity and water. Openreach has been criticised for the slow rollout of rural broadband and for failing to offer radical new technologies. But, on the flipside, there are no large queues of other operators lining up to fix the problem, which is expensive and technically challenging. The Countryside and Landowners' Alliance pointed out that any split must make sure that the work Openreach is doing to close the digital divide can continue unhindered. \"Any formal break between BT and Openreach must not lose sight of the goal to deliver broadband to rural areas. Ofcom must make it clear that the conditions of the separation include guarantees for future investment to further support rural digital connectivity,\" it said in a statement. Will a split lead to better, cheaper broadband? What consumers really need, according to Andrew Ferguson, founder of the broadband news website ThinkBroadband, is \"fibre to the home with gigabit speeds for \u00c2\u00a320 to \u00c2\u00a335 per month\". Fibre-to-the-home technology offers faster speeds than the majority of current broadband connections, which are known as \"fibre to the cabinet\", meaning the final connection to homes is delivered over slower copper wire. Mr Ferguson told the BBC that no-one currently knows whether a legal separation will deliver this faster option. \"The split has the potential to be very transformational and start the UK down a path of 95% fibre-to-the-premises coverage in 10 years, but that was a possibility yesterday too. The key is whether the split means more money will be available and if a fibre-to-the-premises (home) product is adopted by operators like Sky and TalkTalk,\" he said. \"The hope is that by reducing the influence of BT Group on Openreach, it would be likely to invest more in faster broadband technology that allows more providers, such as Sky and TalkTalk as well as BT, to offer a better service to their customers.\" But, he added, there is a counter-argument that an independent Openreach could create \"a stock market that gets jittery which means that Openreach is starved of capital and struggles to meet what its critics have said are already unambitious rollout targets\". Most agree that a separation of BT and Openreach would not alone solve the UK's broadband problems. Richard Neudegg, head of regulation at uSwitch, said: \"Ofcom needs to act across the board to ensure competition and service improvements. This includes universal service obligations, quality of service requirements on regulated products and automatic compensation when providers fail to deliver. Some believe that the real problem with the UK's broadband is that the copper network simply does not offer the bandwidth and reliability to support our increasingly data-rich needs. Founder of Mimosa Networks, Jaime Fink thinks it is time to consider other technologies: \"Openreach and other UK service providers must change their approach and look at new technologies that can profitably deliver a superfast sustainable broadband network.\" He pointed to the US where new entrants such as Google and Facebook have shaken up the market with fixed wireless solutions, which are less expensive than fibre. Will a split improve customer service? You have a broadband fault but it is taking weeks to fix. Sound familiar? One of the biggest arguments in favour of a split is that Openreach has just not provided adequate levels of customer service. Critics say this is because it is not a customer-facing firm so all complaints are channelled via a customer's ISP, giving it no incentive to get on with repairs. \"Millions of people have suffered woeful levels of service from Openreach, so these reforms must lead to significant improvements for customers who have been let down for too long,\" said Which's Alex Neill, managing director of Home and Legal. But will a separation deliver this? It may depend on how the separation looks, thinks Ovum analyst Matthew Howett. \"The improvements in quality and availability of service that Ofcom hopes legal separation will bring about will likely to be delivered much sooner if BT can get on and deliver them today as a result of a voluntary agreement, rather than wait for a lengthy and uncertain process to run its course at the EU level,\" he told the BBC. In order to start the legal separation, Ofcom must now prepare a formal notification to the European Commission to start the process. Mr Howett believes that the door is still open for a voluntary agreement from BT. \"In many ways that would be a better outcome than a forced legal separation, not least because the EU route is uncertain, untested and likely to take much longer to achieve. It is also of course made more complex by the decision from Britain to leave the EU.\"", "text": ["Talks", "between", "BT", "and", "regulator", "Ofcom", "to", "find", "a", "voluntary", "solution",

amongst the first and most dynamic Special Economic Zones. The meeting at which the ideological innovations were reached which made the acceptance of foreign capital and a market in China possible were at Jingxi Hotel in Beijing in December 1978. Over three and a half decades later, the approximately 400 super-elite of the party met in the same place again. This in itself created expectations that historic events were about to occur. The communique from the Third Plenum of the 18th Party Congress issued on 12 November after the three-day meeting should put paid to the notion that this leadership is about to undertake the same dramatic reverse that the 1978 event achieved. Times are different. The simple fact is that a misstep now would be far more costly than back then, when the country was emerging exhausted from late Maoism and had to do something radical to energise its economy. Now, China is a global economy, and one with everything to play for in the coming decades. Its challenge this time is simply to, in the words of Premier Li Keqiang, unlock new sources of growth within itself. There is no question of it, at the moment at least, needing to fundamentally change track. The mechanism to achieve growth will be improving and perfecting the market, and liberalising new areas where growth might come. That is the most powerful message from this plenum. Challenging the fundamental principles of the Reform and Opening Up era was never going to happen. The primacy of the party is stated with crystal clarity in the plenum report. Its key role in society remains paramount. The need for internal unity and collective leadership remains as prized as it was in the Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao era. The objective is still, through the ideological instruments of Deng Xiaoping theory and Socialism with Chinese characteristics, to achieve \"the primary state of socialism\". That will take, in the words of the communique, \"many years\". There are more explicit references to the creation of a national security coordination body. This seems to be the Hu and Wen fixation with \"pro-stability\" measures in another guise, with some attempt to now finally co-ordinate and streamline decision making in this area, particularly as there is no one on the Standing Committee of the current Politburo with specific responsibility for security issues as there was in the previous one. Q&A: China's Third Plenum Third Plenum: Key issues The premium this leadership places on stability remains high, and the car explosion in Tiananmen in early November along with the home-made bomb attack in Taiyuan at the same time will only highlight to this leadership that relaxing on the issue is not an option. Politburo member Yu Zhengsheng referred before the plenum to deeper new reforms being on the horizon. It is clear now that this referred to introducing a more flexible system whereby rural residents can move to urban areas, find work there, settle there, have access to social welfare and, perhaps most critically of all, educate their children. The government in the last few months has referred heavily to the need to accelerate urbanisation, and having a framework within which to enfranchise and give incentives to rural dwellers so that they can move is important. Implementation however remains key here, so while the statement of intent is strong enough, the question will be how to convince provincial governments across China that they can carry the costs of a new wave of citizens that they somehow have to provide social goods for. There is no explicit mention of whether provinces will therefore be given wider tax raising powers, though this would seem a natural corollary to having a new influx of residents. On economic reform, the strongest theme is that of developing a finance market. Here too we see the intellectual influence of Li Keqiang, the person most closely associated with the establishment in October of a Free Trade Zone in Shanghai, a place where China's capital account might be liberalised and the trading of Chinese yuan accelerated. Finance will be a critical sector for this leadership, one of the key means to delivering a high service component in the economy, and of creating a high value added economy. This plenum gives a framework, which confirms some of the themes that have already emerged from this leadership. No quick ideological or political change, a continuation on emphasising people's material well-being and trying to achieve strong growth, with the key drive being to achieve a high level of urbanisation before 2020. If there is one bold feature of this plan it is that almost everything is staked on an urban China being one where the current problems of achieving growth, answering some of the sustainability issues, and addressing inequality will become more soluble. This is a big gamble, because the rate at which China evidently plans to become urban is faster than any other society has tried. There are vast issues about how social cohesion will be achieved, and what sort of social and political structures might finally come from this to achieve the sort of harmonious society that the previous leadership spoke so much about.

with Nike will earn him up to $250m (\u00a3156m) over 10 years. Why such staggering amounts of money? Why Rory, rather than any other young sportsman? What does this mean for Nike, for Tiger Woods - the man the brand was built around - and for golf? A little context. If accurate, those estimates mean McIlroy's deal is substantially bigger than both Tiger Woods's most recent 10-year Nike contract - reportedly worth \u00a3124m - and David Beckham's lifetime deal with rivals Adidas, estimated to earn the footballer \u00a3100m. So how is such a monumental figure calculated? Source: Forbes. Figures derived from bonuses, salaries, appearance fees, prize money, endorsement and licensing from June 2011 to June 2012. Most Nike golf endorsements are determined by multiplying the player's world ranking points by an agreed figure. Each point could be worth $5,000 to a mid-level Tour player, $10,000 to a bigger name. The better the golfer plays - and so the greater the profile for Nike - the greater the reward, with a guaranteed base-level income factored in to account for ranking fluctuations caused by injury or loss of form. McIlroy's deal is different. Just as his abilities on-course and status off-course exceed those of his Tour colleagues, so too does his value to sponsors. \"There will be a sound business case behind the numbers: 'Rory will help us sell x amount of equipment and clothing',\" says David Cushnan, sports business expert and editor of SportsPro magazine. \"But as scientific as they make it, there will also be an element of gut feeling about this. Nike didn't want their direct rivals to get their hands on him.\" \"There will be both a science side and an art side to the calculations,\" an industry insider told BBC Sport. \"The science works out how much value he can add to a brand, how much he can bring in in golf sales. \"The art side is about reputation. How is the brand talked about on social media? What's the sentiment around that brand?\" Then there is the particular appeal of McIlroy's chosen sport. \"As far as sponsors are concerned, the key sports for individual athlete endorsement are golf and tennis,\" says Cushnan. \"Golf has always been a leader in the value sponsors can get from their investment. \"There is a perception of a higher-end demographic, of supporters with more disposable income. Golfers don't tend to be tied into a team, where you can have sponsorship clashes - like Messi wearing Adidas boots but with a Nike swoosh on his Barcelona shirt - that affect the value of your deal. \"You get a golfer 100%. And there are more opportunities for golfers to do promotional work. They are more in control of their own schedules than a team player like a footballer. \"From Nike's point of view, they will want full control over everything McIlroy does. The size of the deal helps them make a statement, but it will be incredibly comprehensive, which will limit his opportunities elsewhere.\" Which leads us to another multiplying factor in the deal. McIlroy had existing contracts with equipment manufacturer Titleist, Dubai-based hotel group Jumeirah, sunglasses brand Oakley, Santander bank and watchmaker Audemars Piguet. Only the Santander deal has lapsed, meaning part of the \u00a3156m will have been set aside to buy him out of those other contracts. Then there is the competition. Titleist were never likely to get caught up in an auction. Their business model is based more on the reputation of their clubs and balls than holding on to their one-time star endorsements like Woods, Phil Mickelson and Ernie Els. Callaway, the company that signed the latter two players from Titleist, have endured a series of poor financial returns in recent years. But that left one other, the company that dominates the \u00a315bn US golf market: TaylorMade. According to sources close to the deal, the Adidas-owned equipment brand offered close to \u00a3100m for McIlroy's signature. But Nike, driven by a series of critical events, refused to be outbid. For someone who had just authorised a \u00a3156m outlay on a single player yet to win either the Masters or Open, Nike Golf president Cindy Davis spent Monday's news conference wearing a wide smile. Source: SportsPro. Rankings based on marketing potential from 2012-2015. The company's golf division has endured successive bad years, seeing revenues drop 2% in the 2010 financial year and 4% in 2011. Nike as a whole has been hit with successive scandals involving its marquee names - the jailing of NFL star Michael Vick for his part in a dog-fighting ring, the revelations from Woods's private life, and now the dramatic fall of Lance Armstrong. McIlroy, like no other sportsman, can help turn both issues around. \"Nike have been stung badly by the fallout from those scandals,\" says Cushnan. \"Long-term they are looking for someone to replace Tiger from both a broadcast and fan perspective. \"Nike are facing greater competition than ever before - from Adidas, from Chinese brand Li Ning. They wanted someone reliable, someone who will be at the top of the game for a significant period. \"They will feel really confident that Rory is the right man to lead their brand. Golf is genuinely global now - if you back a top golfer, you are highly visible in the US, in Europe and Asia too.\" Woods's first five-year Nike contract, signed in 1996 when he was still to turn pro, was worth an unprecedented \u00a325m. His second, signed in 2001, was two and a half times as big again. While both made complete financial sense to the company, Tiger is no longer enough on his own. McIlroy, say insiders, has not been signed as a like-for-like replacement. Instead, expect to see the two marketed together - Woods chasing the four more major wins he needs to match Jack Nicklaus's record, McIlroy battling him as the new generation. \"It's a very clever call from Nike,\" an industry source told BBC Sport. \"Both Nike and golf need Tiger and Rory going down the 18th together. They will have lots of fun on the global market with Tiger and Rory as a pair.\" McIlroy is the current world number one, the youngest multiple major winner since Seve Ballesteros 32 years ago, PGA player of the year, European Tour golfer of the year and winner of both PGA and European tour money lists. But there is more. \"Rory is an extraordinary athlete who creates enormous excitement with his on-course performance while, at the same time, connecting with fans everywhere.\" Cindy Davis, Nike Golf President, on Rory McIlory \"Very obviously, he's the best in the business, and last season simply underlined that,\" says Cushnan. \"Beyond that, he's very clean-cut - what Tiger used to be - and he is well-spoken and eloquent. \"He understands the media and commercial side of sport. He has deftly avoided most controversies. In an uncertain world for sponsors, he is a safe bet.\" Then there is the look, the personality. \"Rory has the smile, he has that hair, he has the Irish blarney,\" says a source close to the deal. \"He is a genuine superstar, instantly recognisable, hugely likeable. Even when it all went wrong for him, as at the Masters in 2011, he dealt with it brilliantly, in a way that endeared him to as many people as winning it would have done.\" McIlroy and Woods are not the only golfers Nike sponsors. But while Paul Casey, Charl Schwartzel or Anthony Kim carry resonance with golf fans, only McIlroy's appeal stretches outside the sport. As Nike's Davis gushed on Monday: \"Rory is an extraordinary athlete who creates enormous excitement with his on-course performance while, at the same time, connecting with fans everywhere.\" McIlroy will also aid Nike's boost to be seen as a credible manufacturer of clubs and balls. Despite Woods's successes, the company's reputation still lags behind that of specialists like Titleist and TaylorMade. McIlroy should, on precedent and ability, win more tournaments and more majors, than any other player of the next five years. Nike equipment could receive no greater reciprocal endorsement. The charismatic Northern Irishman caused considerable surprise when he left former agent Chubby Chandler's ISM management group in 2011 to sign for the Dublin-based Horizon Sports Management. With this deal, his new agent Conor Ridge is delivering what his new client reportedly wanted - to be established as a global presence. Nike are likely to have retained final approval over any other sponsorship deal McIlroy signs. This will limit Ridge to brands that cannot clash with the sportswear giant - car companies, financial services suppliers. But that control is one reason for the unprecedented size of the contract. Ten years might strike some as a long contract in an uncertain world. But there is logic in the deal's length. \"It's about as safe a bet as a company can make,\" says Cushnan, whose magazine rated McIlroy as the second most marketable sportsman in the world last year. \"Not many people are suggesting that in a couple of years McIlroy will have peaked. He will be world number one or thereabouts. There is also plenty left for him to do; he has yet to win the Masters or the Open, so his peak is a long way off. \"By signing him for 10 years Nike are both showing that they don't want anyone else, and being able to plan long-term marketing campaigns and branded products.\" What risks are attached? McIlroy, who dates Danish tennis star Caroline Wozniacki, has found himself in the occasional pickle since turning pro - describing the Ryder Cup as an \"exhibition\" in 2009, complaining about the weather at the 2011 Open, having a row on Twitter with pundit Jay Townsend. All three were minor affairs, followed by apology and explanation. Nike should not have another Tiger or Lance in the pipeline. The biggest danger to either side? The equipment itself. Sir Nick Faldo has already described McIlroy's switch from Titleist clubs and ball as \"dangerous\". Although he has been practising with them for several weeks, McIlroy will only use his new clubs competitively for the first time in the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship later this week. \"Every manufacturer will tell you we can copy your clubs and tweak the golf ball so it fits you,\" says Faldo. \"But there is a feel and sound as well, and there's confidence.\" If a player like McIlroy switched clubs at any stage of his career there would be great subsequent interest in whether it affected his tournament finishes. That he has done so in a deal of this magnitude will only intensify that focus. \"He is up there to be knocked,\" says an industry source. \"If Rory goes four or five tournaments without performing, the questions will start. The word in the industry is that the product must be amazing for him to have taken the risk.\"", "text": ["While", "the", "exact", "figures", "have", "not", "been", "made", "public", ",", "insiders",

app in return for a shot,\" says the 29-year-old. Then at UK lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) festivals Manchester and Brighton Pride, she targeted women by standing outside the portable toilets handing out toilet paper with flyers promoting the app. This was back in 2013, and Ms Exton's low cost, but innovative, approach to marketing soon saw user numbers rise steadily, then further gaining traction thanks to positive word of mouth. Founded in London, but with its headquarters moving to San Francisco last year in order to be closer to US investors, and to be in the thick of the burgeoning social network scene, the Her app now has more than one million female users around the world. Her was born from Ms Exton's frustration with existing lesbian dating websites and apps, which she didn't think were good enough. She says the market was dominated by \"dating sites that were initially created for gay men, and tuned pink for lesbians\". Ms Exton had an inside business knowledge of this because at the time she was working for a London-based branding agency, where her client made dating platforms. The light bulb moment when she decided to do something about the situation came when she was in a pub with two friends, one of whom had split with her girlfriend. Ms Exton says: \"We told her you've got to join these sites to meet someone else, there's no other choice. \"It was crazy because I knew the industry because of my client, and I thought, 'is this the best that exists to women? Because it's embarrassing, and humiliating that we are forced to use these'.\" So Ms Exton quit her job, and began work on developing Her. Moving in with her father to save money, she worked in a pub on evenings and weekends, and taught herself how to computer programme. Armed with \u00a310,000 of savings, including a \u00a34,000 lottery win, Ms Exton launched the first incarnation of Her in 2013, initially calling it Dattch, which stood for \"date catch\". To secure support and business advice she successfully gained a place on start-up mentoring programme Wayra, which is run by telecommunications firm Telefonica. Initially just a dating app, additional material has been added over the past three years, including a news section, and event listings. \"We made it much more of a social experience for our users,\" says Ms Exton. \"A large percentage of our users are in a relationship, but use the app to find out what's happening in the city, read LGBT content, and make friends in their area.\" Meanwhile, the name was changed to Her in March 2015. \"People couldn't spell Dattch,\" says Ms Exton. Since its launch, Her has raised $2.5m (\u00a31.7m) in funding, with US investors including Michael Birch, founder of social network Bebo, and Alexis Ohanian, co-founder of news platform Reddit. However, it has yet to make any money, as Ms Exton has so far followed the well-trodden path of gaining traction by offering a free service. Revenues may finally start to arrive later this year when Her launches a premium, paid-for version of the app. Ms Exton won't be drawn on prices, and what it will entail, but she does say there will be \"extra value-added features\". Technology analyst Britanny Carter of research group IbisWorld says that apps such as Her, that cater to specific demographics, are able to effectively carve a niche within the online dating space. She adds: \"Including content to further engage users is an excellent way for Her to encourage app usage, especially when the user base is small and growth is critical.\" Yet Ms Carter cautions that Her must always be on guard against potential competitors. \"Like most dating apps, the switching costs between apps is low, so Her will likely face competition from other apps looking to cater to the lesbian market.\" Now based in San Francisco with five colleagues, while two other Her employees remain in London, Ms Exton says the app is always on guard against men trying to sign up. The business estimates that 15% of people trying to join are men pretending to be women. To prevent this, all users have to verify their gender by signing up through their Facebook or Instagram accounts, while Her has other checking mechanisms in place, and genuine users are \"fast to report people that don't respect the community\". On a much more positive note, Ms Exton says she is proud to to hear stories about women who are able to \"figure out a big part of their sexuality\" thanks to joining Her. She recalls the time when a girl came up to her at the end of an event she was speaking at. \"She just wanted to say thank you,\" says Ms Exton. \"She had come across Her... and she could now meet with a group of women similar to her, who made her feel OK, and weren't going to ask her what she identifies as.\"", "text": ["``", "In", "the", "early", "days", "I", "'d", "go", "to", "nightclubs",

{"raw_text": "It provided another reminder of golf's global nature and came just as one of the sport's most influential figures made a significant call for a unified world circuit. PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem wants the leading tours to come together as one. It suggests an intensifying of the current power struggle at the top of the game. Finchem was speaking as Scott edged home ahead of American Bubba Watson, Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy and Englishman Danny Willett last Sunday. It was one of those leaderboards that begged the question of why American venues dominate the WGC tournaments? Only November's HSBC Champions event in China is played outside the borders of the US. Surely these tournaments (Doral, WGC Matchplay and usually WGC Invitational), with their increasingly international fields, should do what they say on the tin? If they are World Golf Championships they should be taken around the globe and not be an almost exclusively American preserve. \"We are constantly looking at ways to grow the World Golf Championships,\" Finchem told BBC Sport. \"Certainly the addition of Shanghai has been a huge success.\" The stumbling block remains finding backers with pockets deep enough to cover winner's cheques of $1.62m stretching down to the $45,000 paid to the 37-over-par backmarker Steven Bowditch despite his four rounds in 80s. Finchem, therefore, reasons that American venues have to continue to dominate. \"The sponsorship structure, the way it is, would probably lead us to stay the course for a bit,\" he said. More significantly he stated his desire to bring together the leading tours under a lone umbrella. Not just WGC's but the entire sport run by a consolidated body. \"What's in the paramount best interest of men's and women's professional golf is coming under one unified organisation with a genuine global brand, and be able to compete on a global level in the global markets, much like soccer,\" he said \"There aren't that many sports that are as in-depth active on virtually every continent as golf. And that's the reason why the IOC (International Olympic Committee) wanted us as part of the Olympics. \"So I think we should be taking advantage of that.\" Finchem is clearly putting the idea back on the table. \"Sooner or later, I think everybody is going to get on that road,\" he added. \"And when they do, I think it is going to be a very positive thing for professional golf.\" The timing may be coincidental, but it is hard to ignore the fact that this emphatic message has been restated early in the new European Tour regime led by Canadian Chief Executive Keith Pelley. The new boss at the Wentworth-based circuit has already shown he is not afraid to take on its big brother on the other side of the pond. Pelley withdrew European Tour support of July's Bridgestone Invitational event, so stripping it of WGC status because it clashes with the French Open. \"It's unfortunate,\" Finchem admitted. Amalgamation, as envisaged by the PGA Tour boss, would guarantee such clashes do not happen in the future. The idea isn't brand new, but it is intriguing that Finchem has chosen to put it back in the public domain. It first surfaced in 2013 after British newspaper reports suggested the American circuit was looking to launch a takeover of the European Tour. Those claims were quickly dismissed by both bodies. Professional golf, however, has moved on significantly since then. Pelley is currently trying to strengthen the European Tour by merging with their Asian counterparts. If that happens the global dynamics will change and, long term, by a potentially significant degree. The Asian market is filled with possibilities and latent revenue streams. Finchem will be monitoring developments carefully. He has also announced much closer ties between his organisation and the LPGA. This should strengthen the women's game and could bolster the appeal of the PGA Tour. Golf's inclusion in this year's Rio Olympics also shakes the game's tectonic plates. The leading tours are positioning themselves to make the most of what could become a significantly changed landscape. First, though, the future of the WGC at the Donald Trump-owned Doral needs to be settled. The US presidential candidate's outspoken campaign comments seem to be less of an issue for the administrators. As ever, money will be the deciding factor. Cadillac's title sponsorship is up for renewal and whoever puts up next year's prize fund will have the biggest say on where it is played. The chances of it remaining at the same South Florida venue seem to be improving, given the PGA commissioner's diplomatic and pragmatic playing down of worries over Trump's contentious election rhetoric. \"We were concerned at one point because he referred to, quote, golf being supportive of some of the more controversial positions he has taken,\" Finchem admitted. But he insisted the Trump relationship remains strong. \"We try to compartmentalise these things, but in terms of his focus on the game, on some of the facilities around the country and internationally, he brings a lot of energy to it. \"He's done a lot of good things.\" The billionaire course owner agreed, with his own nod to pragmatism. \"My relationship is very good (with golf's governing bodies) and I'm also the front-runner,\" he told BBC Sport. \"You know being the front-runner, people like you more than they would if I was number 12.\" Trump is involved in an escalating struggle for influence where golf is a mere bit part. Within the sport itself, though, the power games are also intensifying.", "text": ["It", "provided", "another", "reminder", "of", "golf", "'s", "global", "nature", "and", "came", "just", "as", "one",

And military action so far has had only limited success in pushing it back. So some have suggested a different approach: negotiation. Some find the idea of talks abhorrent - others say it's time to at least consider it. Four experts spoke to BBC World Service's The Inquiry about their views on the question: should anyone ever talk to IS? Jonathan Powell: Time to talk? Jonathan Powell was chief negotiator on Northern Ireland for the British government under Tony Blair. \"If you want to destroy the Islamic State, you're not going to be able to do it from the air. And no one in the West seems prepared to put boots on the ground. So there is no military strategy for destroying Isis. There needs to be a political strategy. In my view, that would involve talking to them. \"All terrorists are barbaric. That's why they're terrorists, because the only thing they have in common is that they use the tool of terror. \"Isis use their violence for a very obvious purpose. They use it to frighten their opponents so they run away. They know that if they kill one Western aid worker, one Western journalist, in a horrific way, they will get a huge amount of publicity. Yes, of course the violence they use is abhorrent, but that doesn't mean to say the lessons we've learnt from dealing with previous terrorist groups all fall away. \"We talked to the IRA, not because they had guns but because they had a third of the Catholic vote. If you were dealing with a group that has almost no political support, such as Baader-Meinhof... you're not going to need to negotiate because there isn't a political question at the heart of the matter. And it seems to me likely that there is a political question at the heart here in Syria and Iraq. \"If the conflicts I've looked at over the last... 30 years are anything to go by, and if Isis have political support, then we will end up speaking to them. Maybe they'll fade like snow in the spring, but there is very little historical precedent for that happening in this sort of circumstance. \"It's my hypothesis that there is such political support. And the idea of extreme Islamists, whether Al Qaeda or Isil, seems to have enough robustness in it that there is a problem we're going to have to address politically at some stage, not simply by force of arms.\" But, Powell says, there are two caveats: you don't stop fighting, and you don't begin those talks now. You prepare the ground, by establishing a basic conversation. Qais Qasim: A view from Baghdad Qais Qasim is a journalist living in Baghdad. Over the past year, he's been following the story of IS, talking to those who've fled from the towns and villages they control. \"They are not a political group, they are a criminal group. They use suicide attacks and explosives instead of words. They have no political demands. \"Isis is not a Sunni movement any more. They get in fights against Sunni tribes. The fight against Isis is not a part of the conflict between Sunnis and Shias. Isis is not based on sectarian philosophy but it's based on a certain way of looking at human life and they think they have the ultimate right to decide who lives and who dies. \"I cannot find anybody here in Baghdad who is willing to talk to Isis. Nobody is willing to give Isis the legitimacy. And if it happens, they will consider it a sign of weakness from the Iraqi security forces. \"People here in Baghdad are very optimistic about the Iraqi forces and the rebuilding of the Iraqi forces.\" \"It's not the time, and it won't be any time, to talk to Isis today and tomorrow and even after five years because they are criminals. You cannot negotiate with savages like Isis fighters. You cannot let a criminal get away with his crime.\" Mina al-Oraibi: Divide and talk Mina al-Oraibi is assistant editor-in-chief at Asharq Alawsat, a London-based Arabic newspaper. \"I come from Iraq, my father's home town is Mosul. So of course I care about it from a personal point of view. I also care about it because I think what will happen in the fight against Isis inside of Iraq will determine much of what will happen in the Middle East and the Arab world. \"I don't believe that it's time to speak to those that are within the top echelons of Isis because there's not much to talk about there, they've made that very clear. \"There are different groups that have come under the fold of Isis in different countries, whether it's in Iraq or in Syria or otherwise that are there for either political gain or because they felt that they were pushed into a corner where they had no other military option. Those are the people that are worth speaking to. \"We've fallen into the trap of treating it almost like it is one strong group. And that's actually been a propaganda win for Isis that many of us who would say that we are against them have enabled. And I think it's very, very important to look at those divisions and inferences and be able to pull people back. \"There are still army generals from Saddam's army who are sitting either in Amman or in the Kurdish region of Iraq or in Turkey, not even in parts of Isis but they're just sitting around given no role. You know some of these army members have connections and would be able to say 'These are the people I can count on, bring them in.' \"Some Iraqis refer to those that are from the provinces controlled by Isis as terrorists. So it's very important to build that trust and so to tell Sunnis that 'we realise that you are victims of this'. Michael Semple: The long game Michael Semple worked in Afghanistan for 18 years, as an aid worker, for the EU and the UN. He was one of only a few who were involved in talks with senior Taliban members. \"I think somebody who proposed political talks now would be considered foolish from both sides. I don't think IS would buy it, I don't think that the countries of the region or the United States would buy it. \"And yet there are very important humanitarian needs and I think it is time... to see who in Islamic State... is prepared to engage on humanitarian issues and make things a little bit better for now. \"IS is big enough, robust enough that it looks as if it's going to be around for quite some time to come, therefore it has structures which I think would be capable of engaging in dialogue... making undertakings which they could subsequently adhere to. But also, because it looks like it's going to be around for quite some time, the price of ignoring them goes up all the time. \"It comes down to the question of whether a humanitarian dialogue... does legitimise the parties involved in that dialogue and, through legitimising them, essentially strengthens them. Now many people... have concluded that it is possible to conduct a humanitarian dialogue without legitimising the parties involved. \"There are regionally-based intermediaries, people who've got some reason to have dealings in areas where IS has a presence. Now quite often it has been religious leaders, sometimes it's business people, traders. I think these are the kind of figures we'd expect to see, long before diplomats. \"I think that the dialogue would have to be worthwhile in its own terms... not with respect to the hope for some eventual political progress. Relationships and confidences which have been built up during that humanitarian dialogue. Later on they might be put to work when the time is right for some kind of political engagement.\" The Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays at 12:05 GMT/13:05 BST.
